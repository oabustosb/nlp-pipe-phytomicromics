Cationic peptides represent a large family of antibiotics and have attracted interest due to their diverse chemical structures and potential for combating drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Here, we analyze 7395 bacterial genomes to investigate their capacity for biosynthesis of cationic nonribosomal peptides with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Applying this approach, we identify two novel compounds (brevicidine and laterocidine) showing bactericidal activities against antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli, and an apparently low risk of resistance. The two peptides show efficacy against E. coli in a mouse thigh infection model. These findings may contribute to the discovery and development of Gram-negative antibiotics.\",\n          \"The present report describes our efforts to identify new structural classes of compounds having promising antibacterial activity using previously published double-reporter system pDualrep2. This semi-automated high-throughput screening (HTS) platform has been applied to perform a large-scale screen of a diverse small-molecule compound library. We have selected a set of more than 125,000 molecules and evaluated them for their antibacterial activity. On the basis of HTS results, eight compounds containing 2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazole scaffold exhibited moderate-to-high activity against \\u00ce\\u201dTolC Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these molecules were in the range of 0.037-8-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1. The most active compound 8 demonstrated high antibacterial potency (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20300.037-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1), that significantly exceed that measured for erythromycin (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20302.5-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1) and was comparable with the activity of levofloxacin (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20300.016-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1). Unfortunately, this compound showed only moderate selectivity toward HEK293 eukaryotic cell line. On the contrary, compound 7 was less potent (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20300.8-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1) but displayed only slight cytotoxicity. Thus, 2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazoles can be considered as a valuable starting point for subsequent optimization and morphing.\",\n          \"Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus colonize similar niches in mammals and conceivably compete for space and nutrients. Here, we report that a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus chromogenes ATCC43764, synthesizes and secretes 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a purine analog that suppresses S. aureus growth by inhibiting de novo purine biosynthesis. We identify a 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes and other coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis, S. pseudintermedius and S. capitis. Recombinant S. aureus strains harbouring this operon produce 6-TG and, when used in subcutaneous co-infections in mice with virulent S. aureus USA300, protect the host from necrotic lesion formation. Used prophylactically, 6-TG reduces necrotic skin lesions in mice infected with USA300, and this effect is mediated by abrogation of toxin production. RNAseq analyses reveal that 6-TG downregulates expression of genes coding for purine biosynthesis, the accessory gene regulator (agr) and ribosomal proteins in S. aureus, providing an explanation for its effect on toxin production.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PubTator_simplified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 79,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['brevicidine', 'Cationic peptides', 'laterocidine']\",\n          \"['2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazole', '2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazoles', 'erythromycin', 'levofloxacin']\",\n          \"['purine', '6-thioguanine', '6-TG']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"T5_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<pad> no</s>\",\n          \"<pad> yes</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ALPACA_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes, context: This report describes our efforts to identify new structural classes of compounds having promising antibacterial activity using previously published double-reporter system pDualrep2.

Bacteria have numerous essential functions, but only a small fraction of such processes are inhibited by current drugs. Targeting metabolic enzymes has been the focus of recent interest, but effective inhibitors have been difficult to identify. We demonstrate that BRD4592, a synthetic azetidine derivative, that kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis through allosteric inhibition of tryptophan synthase (TrpAB), a previously untargeted, highly allosterically regulated enzyme, is required for the survival of Mtb and Mycobacterium marinum in vivo and that this requirement may be independent of an adaptive immune response.
