The adhesion and surface mechanics of biofilms play crucial roles in generating and removing biofilm. Designing customized nanosurfaces with different surface topologies can alter the adhesive properties to remove biofilms more easily and greatly improve long-term biofilm control. To rapidly design such topologies, we employ individual-based modeling and Bayesian optimization to automate the design process and generate different active surfaces for effective biofilm removal. Our framework successfully generated optimized functional nanosurfaces for improved biofilm removal through applied shear and vibration. Densely distributed short pillar topography is the optimal geometry to prevent biofilm formation. Under fluidic shearing, the optimal topography is to sparsely distribute tall, slim, pillar-like structures. When subjected to either vertical or lateral vibrations, thick trapezoidal cones are found to be optimal. Optimizing the vibrational loading indicates a small vibration magnitude with relatively low frequencies is more efficient in removing biofilm. Our results provide insights into various engineering fields that require surface-mediated biofilm control. Our framework can also be applied to more general materials design and optimization.\",\n          \"Bioinspired computing algorithms are population-based probabilistic search optimization approaches inspired by biological evolution and activity. These are highly efficient and can solve several problems based on human, chimpanzee, bird, and insect behavior. These approaches have been proposed by the scientific community over the last two decades for common application to solving bioinformatics design problems. The advanced search boxes in databases such as PubMed, WoS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus to conduct this research. Keywords such as \\\"machine learning,\\\" \\\"bioinspired computing,\\\" \\\"DNA sequence optimization,\\\" and \\\"bioinformatics\\\" were used with OR and AND operators. Journal and conference articles were the two types of articles focused on, and other reports and book chapters were removed using the search engine's parameters. Bioinspired techniques are becoming increasingly popular in computer science, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, aeronautical engineering, and bioinformatics. Parametric comparisons suggest that most classic benchmark approaches can be successfully used by employing bioinspired techniques. 56 % of studies are modification based, 30 % hybrid based, and 14 % multiobjective based. These algorithms can be used to optimize data sets in bioinformatics due to their capacity to solve real-world challenges and their ability to accurately express sequence quality and evaluate DNA sequence optimization.\",\n          \"The EUCASTandtheCLSIhaveestablished different breakpoints for fluconazole and Candida spp. However, the reference methodologies employed to obtain the MICs provide similar results. The aim of this work was to apply supervised classification algorithms to analyze the clinical data used by the CLSI to establish fluconazole breakpoints for Candida infections and to compare these data with the results obtained with the data set used to set up EUCAST fluconazole breakpoints, where the MIC for detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, with a sensitivity of 87%, a false-positive rate of 8%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.89. Five supervised classifiers (J48 and CART decision trees, the OneR decision rule, the na\\u00efve Bayes classifier, and simple logistic regression) were used to analyze the original cohort of patients (Rex\\u2019s data set), which was used to establish CLSI breakpoints, and a later cohort of candidemia (Clancy\\u2019s data set), with which CLSI breakpoints were validated. The target variable was the outcome of the infections, and the predictor variable was the MIC or dose/MIC ratio. For Rex\\u2019s data set, the MIC detecting failures was >8 mg/liter, and for Clancy\\u2019s data set, the MIC detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, in close agreement with the EUCAST breakpoint (MIC > 4 mg/liter). The sensitivities, false-positive rates, and areas under the ROC curve obtained by means of CART, the algorithm with the best statistical results, were 52%, 18%, and 0.7, respectively, for Rex\\u2019s data set and 65%, 6%, and 0.72, respectively, for Clancy\\u2019s data set. In addition, the correlation between outcome and dose/MIC ratio was analyzed for Clancy\\u2019s data set, where a dose/MIC ratio of >75 was associated with successes, with a sensitivity of 93%, a false-positive rate of 29%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83. This dose/MIC ratio of >75 was identical to that found for the cohorts used by EUCAST to establish their breakpoints (a dose/MIC ratio of >75, with a sensitivity of 91%, a false-positive rate of 10%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.90).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"database"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-f154e051-3c0e-46d7-9f61-41ccfe8f81b8\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>TITLE</th>\n","      <th>ABSTRACT</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>A Bio-inspired Approach To Cyber Security</td>\n","      <td>Owing to a growing reliance on information, te...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>A Comparative Survey on Large Language Models ...</td>\n","      <td>The development of large language models (LLMs...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Applications of Machine Learning to the Proble...</td>\n","      <td>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Artificial Immune Systems: A Bio-Inspired Para...</td>\n","      <td>Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are bio-inspir...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Artificial intelligence using a latent diffusi...</td>\n","      <td>Artificial intelligence holds great promise fo...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>174</th>\n","      <td>Data Mining a Medieval Medical Text Reveals Pa...</td>\n","      <td>We used established methodologies from network...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>175</th>\n","      <td>Machine Learning Approaches for Epidemiologica...</td>\n","      <td>Foodborne diseases (FBDs) are infections of th...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>176</th>\n","      <td>Discovery of Novel Type II Bacteriocins Using ...</td>\n","      <td>Antimicrobial compounds first arose in prokary...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>177</th>\n","      <td>The relationship between substrate morphology ...</td>\n","      <td>Biomedical device-associated infection (BAI) a...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>178</th>\n","      <td>Rapid Phenotypic Antibiotic Susceptibility Tes...</td>\n","      <td>Achieving fast antimicrobial susceptibility re...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>179 rows × 2 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-f154e051-3c0e-46d7-9f61-41ccfe8f81b8')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-f154e051-3c0e-46d7-9f61-41ccfe8f81b8 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

The adhesion and surface mechanics of biofilms play crucial roles in generating and removing biofilm. Designing customized nanosurfaces with different surface topologies can alter the adhesive properties to remove biofilms more easily and greatly improve long-term biofilm control. To rapidly design such topologies, we employ individual-based modeling and Bayesian optimization to automate the design process and generate different active surfaces for effective biofilm removal. Our framework successfully generated optimized functional nanosurfaces for improved biofilm removal through applied shear and vibration. Densely distributed short pillar topography is the optimal geometry to prevent biofilm formation. Under fluidic shearing, the optimal topography is to sparsely distribute tall, slim, pillar-like structures. When subjected to either vertical or lateral vibrations, thick trapezoidal cones are found to be optimal. Optimizing the vibrational loading indicates a small vibration magnitude with relatively low frequencies is more efficient in removing biofilm. Our results provide insights into various engineering fields that require surface-mediated biofilm control. Our framework can also be applied to more general materials design and optimization.\",\n          \"Bioinspired computing algorithms are population-based probabilistic search optimization approaches inspired by biological evolution and activity. These are highly efficient and can solve several problems based on human, chimpanzee, bird, and insect behavior. These approaches have been proposed by the scientific community over the last two decades for common application to solving bioinformatics design problems. The advanced search boxes in databases such as PubMed, WoS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus to conduct this research. Keywords such as \\\"machine learning,\\\" \\\"bioinspired computing,\\\" \\\"DNA sequence optimization,\\\" and \\\"bioinformatics\\\" were used with OR and AND operators. Journal and conference articles were the two types of articles focused on, and other reports and book chapters were removed using the search engine's parameters. Bioinspired techniques are becoming increasingly popular in computer science, electrical engineering, applied mathematics, aeronautical engineering, and bioinformatics. Parametric comparisons suggest that most classic benchmark approaches can be successfully used by employing bioinspired techniques. 56 % of studies are modification based, 30 % hybrid based, and 14 % multiobjective based. These algorithms can be used to optimize data sets in bioinformatics due to their capacity to solve real-world challenges and their ability to accurately express sequence quality and evaluate DNA sequence optimization.\",\n          \"The EUCASTandtheCLSIhaveestablished different breakpoints for fluconazole and Candida spp. However, the reference methodologies employed to obtain the MICs provide similar results. The aim of this work was to apply supervised classification algorithms to analyze the clinical data used by the CLSI to establish fluconazole breakpoints for Candida infections and to compare these data with the results obtained with the data set used to set up EUCAST fluconazole breakpoints, where the MIC for detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, with a sensitivity of 87%, a false-positive rate of 8%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.89. Five supervised classifiers (J48 and CART decision trees, the OneR decision rule, the na\\u00efve Bayes classifier, and simple logistic regression) were used to analyze the original cohort of patients (Rex\\u2019s data set), which was used to establish CLSI breakpoints, and a later cohort of candidemia (Clancy\\u2019s data set), with which CLSI breakpoints were validated. The target variable was the outcome of the infections, and the predictor variable was the MIC or dose/MIC ratio. For Rex\\u2019s data set, the MIC detecting failures was >8 mg/liter, and for Clancy\\u2019s data set, the MIC detecting failures was >4 mg/liter, in close agreement with the EUCAST breakpoint (MIC > 4 mg/liter). The sensitivities, false-positive rates, and areas under the ROC curve obtained by means of CART, the algorithm with the best statistical results, were 52%, 18%, and 0.7, respectively, for Rex\\u2019s data set and 65%, 6%, and 0.72, respectively, for Clancy\\u2019s data set. In addition, the correlation between outcome and dose/MIC ratio was analyzed for Clancy\\u2019s data set, where a dose/MIC ratio of >75 was associated with successes, with a sensitivity of 93%, a false-positive rate of 29%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83. This dose/MIC ratio of >75 was identical to that found for the cohorts used by EUCAST to establish their breakpoints (a dose/MIC ratio of >75, with a sensitivity of 91%, a false-positive rate of 10%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.90).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"database"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-c508c4b3-2a7d-41ec-8cf8-08b3986ef5a6\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>TITLE</th>\n","      <th>ABSTRACT</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>A Bio-inspired Approach To Cyber Security</td>\n","      <td>Owing to a growing reliance on information, te...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>A Comparative Survey on Large Language Models ...</td>\n","      <td>The development of large language models (LLMs...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Applications of Machine Learning to the Proble...</td>\n","      <td>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains one of ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Artificial Immune Systems: A Bio-Inspired Para...</td>\n","      <td>Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are bio-inspir...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Artificial intelligence using a latent diffusi...</td>\n","      <td>Artificial intelligence holds great promise fo...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>174</th>\n","      <td>Data Mining a Medieval Medical Text Reveals Pa...</td>\n","      <td>We used established methodologies from network...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>175</th>\n","      <td>Machine Learning Approaches for Epidemiologica...</td>\n","      <td>Foodborne diseases (FBDs) are infections of th...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>176</th>\n","      <td>Discovery of Novel Type II Bacteriocins Using ...</td>\n","      <td>Antimicrobial compounds first arose in prokary...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>177</th>\n","      <td>The relationship between substrate morphology ...</td>\n","      <td>Biomedical device-associated infection (BAI) a...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>178</th>\n","      <td>Rapid Phenotypic Antibiotic Susceptibility Tes...</td>\n","      <td>Achieving fast antimicrobial susceptibility re...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>178 rows × 2 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-c508c4b3-2a7d-41ec-8cf8-08b3986ef5a6')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-c508c4b3-2a7d-41ec-8cf8-08b3986ef5a6 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

But confirming the\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0function of host proteins by wet-lab experiments is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop an in silico tool to identify the\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0function of proteins. In the current study, we developed a model AniAMPpred by considering all the available\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0peptides (AMPs) of length $\\\\in $[10 200] from the animal kingdom. The model utilizes a support vector machine\\u00a0algorithm\\u00a0with deep learning-based features and identifies probable\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0proteins (PAPs) in the genome of animals. The results show that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art classifiers, has very high confidence in its predictions, is not biased and can classify both AMPs and non-AMPs for a diverse peptide length with high accuracy. By utilizing AniAMPpred, we identified 436 PAPs in the genome of Helobdella robusta. To further confirm the functional activity of PAPs, we performed BLAST analysis against known AMPs. On detailed analysis of five selected PAPs, we could observe their similarity with\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0proteins of several animal species. Thus, our proposed model can help the researchers identify PAPs in the genome of animals and provide insight into the functional identity of different proteins. An online prediction server is also developed based on the proposed approach, which is freely accessible at https://aniamppred.anvil.app/.\",\n          \"The percutaneous invasion of microorganisms through damaged skin layers can lead to the onset of infections with potentially life-threatening complications, especially in vulnerable populations like newborns, elderly, and diabetic patients. With the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to almost all the available antibiotics and the unfruitful discovery of new\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0compounds in the last few decades, there is a demand for novel engineering strategies to approach skin and soft tissue infections associated with the used of biomaterials. Naturally occurring anti-biofouling and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0interfaces based on spatial structure offer an unprecedented opportunity for biomaterial design, as they do not contribute to bacterial resistance, do not pollute the environment, and can be easily implemented in a variety of biomaterial interfaces. In this article, we review the complications caused by biomaterials in contact with the skin, especially those that compromise medical adhesives, sutures, and wound dressing materials. Then, we introduced\\u00a0bioinspired\\u00a0designs that can be implemented in those materials based on nano- and microscale topographies.\",\n          \"Infectious diseases not only cause severe health problems but also burden the healthcare system. Therefore, the effective treatment of those diseases is crucial. Both conventional approaches, such as\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents, and novel approaches, like\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0peptides (AMPs), are used to treat infections. However, due to the drawbacks of current approaches, new solutions are still being investigated. One recent approach is the use of AMPs and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents in combination, but determining synergism is with a huge variety of AMPs time-consuming and requires multiple experimental studies. Machine learning (ML)\\u00a0algorithms\\u00a0are widely used to predict biological outcomes, particularly in the field of AMPs, but no previous research reported on predicting the synergistic effects of AMPs and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents. Results Several supervised ML models were implemented to accurately predict the synergistic effect of AMPs and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents. The results demonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Light Gradient Boosted Machine Classifier (oLGBMC) yielded the best test accuracy of 76.92% for predicting the synergistic effect. Besides, the feature importance analysis reveals that the target microbial species, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AMP and the\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents, and the used\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agent were the most important features for the prediction of synergistic effect, which aligns with recent experimental studies in the literature. Conclusion This study reveals that ML\\u00a0algorithms\\u00a0can predict the synergistic activity of two different\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents without the need for complex and time-consuming experimental procedures. The implications support that the ML models may not only reduce the experimental cost but also provide validation of experimental procedures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"database"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-7f4916bf-55d5-40f3-aad4-5bfb4d7b75e3\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>TITLE</th>\n","      <th>ABSTRACT</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>A Bio-inspired Approach To Cyber Security</td>\n","      <td>Owing to a growing reliance on information, te...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>A Comparative Survey on Large Language Models ...</td>\n","      <td>The development of large language models (LLMs...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>A Machine Learning Tool to Predict the Antibac...</td>\n","      <td>The emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-re...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>A Practical Approach for Predicting Antimicrob...</td>\n","      <td>With the reduction in sequencing price and acc...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>A Study of Bio-inspired Computing in Bioinform...</td>\n","      <td>Bioinspired computing algorithms are populatio...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>173</th>\n","      <td>Using machine learning to guide targeted and l...</td>\n","      <td>Early and appropriate empiric antibiotic treat...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>174</th>\n","      <td>Using natural language processing and VetCompa...</td>\n","      <td>Currently there is an incomplete understanding...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>175</th>\n","      <td>VAMPr: VAriant Mapping and Prediction of antib...</td>\n","      <td>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasin...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>176</th>\n","      <td>Variational Autoencoder for Generation of Anti...</td>\n","      <td>Over millennia, natural evolution has allowed ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>177</th>\n","      <td>iAMPCN: a deep-learning approach for identifyi...</td>\n","      <td>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short peptid...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>178 rows × 2 columns</p>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-7f4916bf-55d5-40f3-aad4-5bfb4d7b75e3')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-7f4916bf-55d5-40f3-aad4-5bfb4d7b75e3 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Diagnostics based on sequencing will require rapid and precise mapping against redundant databases because some of the most important determinants, such as antimicrobial resistance and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) alleles, are highly similar to one another. In order to facilitate this, a novel mapping method, KMA (k-mer alignment), was designed. KMA is able to map raw reads directly against redundant databases, it also scales well for large redundant databases. KMA uses k-mer seeding to speed up mapping and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to accurately align extensions from k-mer seeds.

The bacterial pathogens develop AMR by two types of mechanisms, one is intrinsic resistance due to the mutations in chromosomal genes and another is extrinsic resistance by the acquisition of external plasmid-mediated genes. The key to diagnosis AMR lies in the DNA sequence of bacteria harboring the resistance-conferring mechanisms.

These issues not only pose serious threats to patient health by increasing the risk of infections but also exert a considerable economic burden on national healthcare systems due to prolonged hospital stays and additional treatments. To address this challenge, there is a need for smart, customized biomaterials for medical device manufacturing, particularly through the development of surface modification strategies that prevent bacterial adhesion and the growth of mature biofilms. This review explores three bioinspired approaches through which antibacterial and antiadhesive coatings can be engineered to exhibit smart, stimuli-responsive features. This responsiveness is greatly valuable as it provides the coatings with a controlled, on-demand antibacterial response that is activated only in the presence of bacteria, functioning as self-defensive coatings.

This pipeline produced 21 models targeting antimicrobial, antiviral, and antibacterial activity, achieving average precision exceeding 83%. Benchmark analyses revealed that our models outperformed existing methods for AMPs and delivered comparable results for other biological activity types. Utilizing the Peptide Atlas, we applied AMP-Detector to discover over 190,000 potential AMPs and demonstrated that it is an integrative approach with generative learning to aid in de novo design,

This approach was then used to design peptide antibiotics not homologous to known natural or synthetic AMPs. In a second approach, many novel putative AMPs were identified from DNA sequences in EST databases, using the observation that, as a rule, specific subclasses of highly conserved signal peptides are associated exclusively with AMPs.

However, antimicrobial treatment is often prescribed ‘empirically’, in the absence of antibiotic susceptibility testing, risking mismatched and therefore ineffective treatment. Here, linking a 10-year longitudinal data set of over 700,000 community-acquired urinary tract infections with over 5,000,000 individually resolved records of antibiotic purchases, we identify strong associations of antibiotic resistance with the demographics, records of past urine cultures and history of drug purchases of the patients. When combined, these associations allow for machine-learning-based personalized drug-specific predictions of antibiotic resistance, thereby enabling drug-prescribing algorithms that match an antibiotic treatment recommendation to the expected resistance of each sample.', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: Develop an artificial intelligence model to predict an antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in patients with urinary tract infection.

However, rediscovery of known antibiotics demonstrates a need for approaches that accurately identify potential novelty with higher throughput and reduced labor. Here we describe an explainable artificial intelligence classification methodology that emphasizes prediction performance and human interpretability by using a Hierarchical Ensemble of Classifiers model optimized with a novel feature selection algorithm called Clairvoyance; collectively referred to as a CoHEC model. We evaluated our methods using whole transcriptome responses from Escherichia coli challenged with 41 known antibiotics and 9 crude extracts while depositing 122 transcriptomes unique to this study.

Recently, researchers are interested in designing alternative drugs based on AMPs because they have found that a large number of bacterial strains have become resistant to available antibiotics. However, researchers have encountered obstacles in the AMPs designing process as experiments to extract AMPs from protein sequences are costly and require a long set-up time. Therefore, a computational tool for AMPs prediction is needed to resolve this problem. In this study, an integrated algorithm is newly introduced to predict AMPs by integrating sequence alignment and support vector machine- (SVM-) LZ complexity pairwise algorithm. It was observed that, when all sequences in the training set are used, the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm is 95.28% in jackknife test and 87.59% in independent test,', 'Yes, context: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been identified as a potential new class of anti-infectives for drug development. There are a lot of computational methods that try to predict AMPs. Most of them can only predict if a peptide will show any antimicrobial potency, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no tools which can predict antimicrobial potency against particular strains. Here we present a predictive model of linear AMPs being active against particular Gram-negative strains relying on a semi-supervised machine-learning approach with a density-based clustering algorithm. The algorithm can well distinguish peptides active against particular strains from others which may also be active but not against the considered strain.

Inclusion of seven concentrations per antibiotic plus technical replicates enabled us to determine a precise minimum inhibitory concentration for 70 clinical uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. By combining optical recordings of bacterial growth and an algorithm for optical signal analysis, we calculated Tlag, the point of transition from lag to exponential phase, in each nanoculture.

Diagnostics based on sequencing will require rapid and precise mapping against redundant databases because some of the most important determinants, such as antimicrobial resistance and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) alleles, are highly similar to one another. In order to facilitate this, a novel mapping method, KMA (k-mer alignment), was designed. KMA is able to map raw reads directly against redundant databases, it also scales well for large redundant databases. KMA uses k-mer seeding to speed up mapping and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to accurately align extensions from k-mer seeds. Multi-mapping reads are resolved using a novel sorting scheme (ConClave scheme), ensuring an accurate selection of templates. With KMA, it was possible map raw reads directly against redundant databases with high accuracy, speed and memory efficiency.', 'No, context: Antibiotic resistance is fueled by antibiotic misuse and has become a major global health concern. The phenomenon warrants improved diagnostics that can more rapidly and efficiently elucidate information about the infectious agent to aid in establishing a more targeted and knowledge-based treatment regimen.

This paper also introduces a method for direct urine testing that can help save days of diagnosis time. The platform is expected to promote more judicious use of antibiotics, thereby reducing the emergence of antibiotic resistance, lowering healthcare costs and ultimately saving lives.', 'Yes', 'No, context: The emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to current antimicrobial agents is the foremost public health concern that continues to pose challenges in the selection of therapeutic regimens to treat infectious diseases. The bacterial pathogens develop AMR by two types of mechanisms, one is intrinsic resistance due to the mutations in chromosomal genes and another is extrinsic resistance by the acquisition of external plasmid-mediated genes. The key to diagnosis AMR lies in the DNA sequence of bacteria harboring the resistance-conferring mechanisms. Moreover, machine learning (ML) has created novel opportunities to significantly solve healthcare problems using bioinformatics techniques. In the last decade, nature-inspired intelligence (NII) has aided the development of machine learning tools for diagnosing antibacterial resistance gene patterns. The successful implementation of these algorithms, especially on complex and intricate problems, indicates their importance in artificial intelligence (AI).

Methods: We used machine learning to assess the effect of antimicrobial agents on bacteria, comparing FAST results with broth microdilution (BMD) antimicrobial susceptibility tests (ASTs). Results: CA was achieved in 35 (83 %) and EA in 28 (67 %) by machine learning on first pass in a challenge panel of 27 Gram-negative and 15 Gram-positive ASTs.

Computer-aided identification and design tools are indispensable for developing these antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have aroused intense interest, since they have a broad spectrum of activity. Several systems for predicting antimicrobial peptides have been developed, using scalar physicochemical properties; however, regardless of the machine learning algorithm, these systems often fail in discriminating AMPs from their shuffled versions, leading to the need for new training methods to overcome this bias. Here we present “Sense the Moment”, a prediction system capable of discriminating AMPs from their shuffled versions.

These issues not only pose serious threats to patient health by increasing the risk of infections but also exert a considerable economic burden on national healthcare systems due to prolonged hospital stays and additional treatments. To address this challenge, there is a need for smart, customized biomaterials for medical device manufacturing, particularly through the development of surface modification strategies that prevent bacterial adhesion and the growth of mature biofilms. This review explores three bioinspired approaches through which antibacterial and antiadhesive coatings can be engineered to exhibit smart, stimuli-responsive features. This responsiveness is greatly valuable as it provides the coatings with a controlled, on-demand antibacterial response that is activated only in the presence of bacteria, functioning as self-defensive coatings. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of developing antibiotic resistance and reduces the need for continuous, high-dose antibacterial treatments, thereby preserving the natural microbiome and further reducing healthcare costs.', 'No, context: We present an adaptive neural network model for chemical data classification. The method uses an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing the network structure by seeking sparsely connected architectures. We used the method for predicting antimicrobial peptide activity from the amino acid sequence. Visualization of the evolved sparse network structures suggested a high charge density and a low aggregation potential in solution as beneficial for antimicrobial activity. However, different training data sets and peptide representations resulted in greatly varying network structures. Overall, the sparse network models turned out to be less accurate than fully-connected networks. In a prospective application, we synthesized and tested 10 de novo generated peptides that were predicted to either possess antimicrobial activity, or to be inactive.', 'Yes, context: Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest challenges of our time. This global health problem originated from a paucity of truly effective antibiotic classes and an increased incidence of multi-drug-resistant bacterial isolates in hospitals worldwide. Indeed, it has been recently estimated that 10 million people will die annually from drug-resistant infections by the year 2050. Therefore, the need to develop out-of-the-box strategies to combat antibiotic resistance is urgent. The biological world has provided natural templates, called antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which exhibit multiple intrinsic medical properties including the targeting of bacteria. AMPs can be used as scaffolds and, via engineering, can be reconfigured for optimized potency and targetability toward drug-resistant pathogens. Here, we review the recent development of tools for the discovery, design, and production of AMPs and propose that the future of peptide drug discovery will involve the convergence of computational and synthetic biology principles.', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: Integrating service robots into contemporary healthcare systems has significantly advanced the scope and complexity of robotic design, especially regarding the materials used in direct interaction with patients and sterile medical environments.

Coupled with the new generation of high-throughput technology for AMP mining, the number of derivatives has increased dramatically, but manual running is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, it is necessary to establish databases that combine computer algorithms to summarize, analyze, and design new AMPs. A number of AMP databases have already been established, such as the Antimicrobial Peptides Database (APD), the Collection of Antimicrobial Peptides (CAMP), the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP), and the Database of Antimicrobial Peptides (dbAMPs).

Given the rapid, ongoing increase in availability of high density genomic data for a diverse array of bacteria, development of algorithms that could utilize genomic information to predict phenotype could both be useful clinically and assist with discovery of heretofore unrecognized AMR pathways. To facilitate understanding of the connections between DNA variation and phenotypic AMR, we developed a bioinformatics tool, variant mapping and prediction of antibiotic resistance (VAMPr), to (1) derive gene Ortholog-based sequence features for variants; (2) interrogate these explainable gene-level variants for their known or novel associations with AMR; and (3) build accurate models to predict AMR based on whole genome sequencing data.', 'Yes, context: Over millennia, natural evolution has allowed for the emergence of countless biomolecules with highly specific roles within natural systems. As seen with peptides and proteins, often evolution produces molecules with a similar function but with variable amino acid composition and structure but diverging from a common ancestor, which can limit sequence diversity. Using antimicrobial peptides as a model biomolecule, we train a generative deep learning algorithm on a database of known antimicrobial peptides to generate novel peptide sequences with antimicrobial activity. Using a variational autoencoder, we are able to generate a latent space plot that can be surveyed for peptides with known properties and interpolated across a predictive vector between two defined points to identify novel peptides that show dose-responsive antimicrobial activity.', 'Yes, context: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short peptides that play crucial roles in diverse biological processes and have various functional activities against target organisms.

of data in genome databases.\\u00a0Antimicrobial\\u00a0host defense proteins provide protection against invading microbes. But confirming the\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0function of host proteins by wet-lab experiments is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, there is a need to develop an in silico tool to identify the\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0function of proteins. In the current study, we developed a model AniAMPpred by considering all the available\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0peptides (AMPs) of length $\\\\in $[10 200] from the animal kingdom. The model utilizes a support vector machine\\u00a0algorithm\\u00a0with deep learning-based features and identifies probable\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0proteins (PAPs) in the genome of animals. The results show that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art classifiers, has very high confidence in its predictions, is not biased and can classify both AMPs and non-AMPs for a diverse peptide length with high accuracy. By utilizing AniAMPpred, we identified 436 PAPs in the genome of Helobdella robusta. To further confirm the functional activity of PAPs, we performed BLAST analysis against known AMPs. On detailed analysis of five selected PAPs, we could observe their similarity with\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0proteins of several animal species. Thus, our proposed model can help the researchers identify PAPs in the genome of animals and provide insight into the functional identity of different proteins. An online prediction server is also developed based on the proposed approach, which is freely accessible at https://aniamppred.anvil.app/.\",\n          \"The percutaneous invasion of microorganisms through damaged skin layers can lead to the onset of infections with potentially life-threatening complications, especially in vulnerable populations like newborns, elderly, and diabetic patients. With the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to almost all the available antibiotics and the unfruitful discovery of new\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0compounds in the last few decades, there is a demand for novel engineering strategies to approach skin and soft tissue infections associated with the used of biomaterials. Naturally occurring anti-biofouling and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0interfaces based on spatial structure offer an unprecedented opportunity for biomaterial design, as they do not contribute to bacterial resistance, do not pollute the environment, and can be easily implemented in a variety of biomaterial interfaces. In this article, we review the complications caused by biomaterials in contact with the skin, especially those that compromise medical adhesives, sutures, and wound dressing materials. Then, we introduced\\u00a0bioinspired\\u00a0designs that can be implemented in those materials based on nano- and microscale topographies.\",\n          \"Infectious diseases not only cause severe health problems but also burden the healthcare system. Therefore, the effective treatment of those diseases is crucial. Both conventional approaches, such as\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents, and novel approaches, like\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0peptides (AMPs), are used to treat infections. However, due to the drawbacks of current approaches, new solutions are still being investigated. One recent approach is the use of AMPs and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents in combination, but determining synergism is with a huge variety of AMPs time-consuming and requires multiple experimental studies. Machine learning (ML)\\u00a0algorithms\\u00a0are widely used to predict biological outcomes, particularly in the field of AMPs, but no previous research reported on predicting the synergistic effects of AMPs and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents. Results Several supervised ML models were implemented to accurately predict the synergistic effect of AMPs and\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents. The results demonstrated that the hyperparameter-optimized Light Gradient Boosted Machine Classifier (oLGBMC) yielded the best test accuracy of 76.92% for predicting the synergistic effect. Besides, the feature importance analysis reveals that the target microbial species, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AMP and the\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents, and the used\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agent were the most important features for the prediction of synergistic effect, which aligns with recent experimental studies in the literature. Conclusion This study reveals that ML\\u00a0algorithms\\u00a0can predict the synergistic activity of two different\\u00a0antimicrobial\\u00a0agents without the need for complex and time-consuming experimental procedures. The implications support that the ML models may not only reduce the experimental cost but also provide validation of experimental procedures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"T5_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<pad> yes</s>\",\n          \"<pad> No</s>\",\n          \"<pad> no</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ALPACA_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 112,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes, context: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are gaining popularity as anti-infective agents.
