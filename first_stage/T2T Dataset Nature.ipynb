This semi-automated high-throughput screening platform has been applied to perform a large-scale screen of a diverse small-molecule compound library. We have selected a set of more than 125,000 molecules and evaluated their antibacterial activity. On the basis of HTS results, eight compounds containing 2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazole scaffold exhibited moderate-to-high activity against Î”TolC Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these molecules were in the range of 0.037-8-', 'No, context: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a pathogen that mainly affects children and elderly individuals. The numerous serotypes and increased resistance to antibiotics make the treatment of pneumococcal infections sometimes difficult. Here, we show that a simulated choline binding polypeptide (ChBp) of LytA has antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. ChBp showed specific antimicrobial activity against pneumococcal but not against non-streptococcal strains, and no cytotoxic effect was observed for 293t cell. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is between 10-25-Î14g/ml. In addition, we found ChBp functions by binding to the choline in the cell wall with a binding capacity between 3.25 and 7.5-—', 'Yes, context: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for an increasing number of deaths caused by antibiotic-resistant infections1,2. The bacterial natural product colistin is considered the last line of defence against a number of Gram-negative pathogens. The recent global spread of the plasmid-borne mobilized colistin-resistance gene mcr-1 (phosphoethanolamine transferase) threatens the usefulness of colistin3. Bacteria-derived antibiotics often appear in nature as collections of similar structures that are encoded by evolutionaryally related biosynthetic gene clusters. This structural diversity is, at least in part, expected to be a response to the development of natural resistance, which often mechanistically mimics clinical resistance. Here we propose that a solution to mcr-1-mediated resistance might have evolved among naturally occurring colistin congeners.', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising alternatives to classical antibiotics for the treatment of drug-resistant infections. Due to their versatility and unlimited sequence space, AMPs can be rationally designed by modulating physicochemical determinants to favor desired biological parameters and turned into novel therapeutics. In this study, we utilized key structural and physicochemical parameters, in combination with rational engineering, to design novel short Î-helical hybrid peptides inspired by the well-known natural peptides, cathelicidin and aurein. Two peptide derivatives, P7 and A3, were generated by amino acid substitution based on their residue composition and distribution. In order to enhance antimicrobial activity, a hybrid analog of P7A3 was designed. The results demonstrated that P7A3 had higher antibacterial activity than the parental peptides with unexpectedly high hemolytic activity.', 'Yes, context: New antibiotics with novel targets are greatly needed. Bacteria have numerous essential functions, but only a small fraction of such processes are inhibited by current drugs. Targeting metabolic enzymes has been the focus of recent interest, but effective inhibitors have been difficult to identify. We demonstrate that BRD4592, a synthetic azetidine derivative, that kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis through allosteric inhibition of tryptophan synthase (TrpAB), a previously untargeted, highly allosterically regulated enzyme, is required for the survival of Mtb and Mycobacterium marinum in vivo and that this requirement may be independent of an adaptive immune response. This work highlights the effectiveness of allosteric inhibition for targeting proteins that are naturally highly dynamic and', 'Yes, context: The dearth of new medicines effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a growing global public health concern1. For more than five decades, the search for new antibiotics has relied heavily on the chemical modification of natural products (semisynthesis) a method ill-equipped to combat rapidly evolving resistance threats. Semisynthetic modifications are typically of limited scope within polyfunctional antibiotics, usually increase molecular weight, and seldom permit modifications of the underlying scaffold. When properly designed, fully synthetic routes can easily address these shortcomings2. This report reports on the structure-guided design and component-based synthesis of a rigid oxepanoproline scaffold which, when linked to the aminooctose residue of clindamycin, produces an antibiotic of exceptional potency and spectrum of activity, which we name iboxamycin.', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: Bioassay-guided screening of antibacterial compounds from the cultured marine Streptomyces sp. ICN19 provided Ala-geninthiocin (1), along with its known analogs geninthiocin (2) and Val-geninthiocin (3) and the indolocarbazole staurosporine (4). The structure of 1 was determined on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR spectra and ESI-HRMS analysis. The absolute configurations of the amino acid residues were determined by enantioselective GC-MS analysis. Compound 1 exhibited potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Micrococcus luteus, as well as cytotoxicity against A549 human lung', 'Yes, context: The emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious global problem which requires the development of new effective antimicrobial therapeutics. Albicidin produced by the sugarcane pathogen Xanthomonas albilineans is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor with inhibitory effects significantly better than most DNA gyrase inhibitors. Albicidin acts primarily by inhibiting the religation of the cleaved DNA intermediate during the gyrase catalytic sequence similar to quinolones. The clinical realization of Albicidin has been hampered by limited production and its unsolved structure. Recent efforts to solve the structure and produce Albicidin in a heterologous host and chemically summarized', 'Yes.', 'Yes, context: Selective isolation of soil Actinobacteria is undertaken to isolate a new class of antibiotics and bioactive molecules. Streptomyces sp.PSAA01 (=-MTCC 13,157), isolated from soil of Eastern Himalaya foothill was cultivated on a large scale for the production of the antimicrobial SM02. It has been found that the maximum amount of SM02 produced whilePSAA01 was grown in ISP-2 medium (pH 7.0) for 7 days at 30 °C in shaking (180 rpm) condition. A significant zone of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96 has been found with the crude cell-free culture media (50 L) of 7 days grown PSAA01. After the purification and chemical structural characterization, we found that SM02 is a new antibiotic having 746 dalton molecular weight. The compound SM02 contains pyrimidine moiety in it and is produced by a species of Streptomyces', 'Yes, context: This study aims to investigate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities of YycG inhibitors H2-60 and H2-81 against Streptococcus agalactiae.', 'Yes, context: Four anthraquinone derivatives, termstrin A, B, C and D (1-4), were isolated and purified from termite-associated Streptomyces sp. BYF63. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses (HR-ESI-MS, 1D and 2D NMR). Compounds 1 and 4 were found to possess potent antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, with ZOI values of 12.85 and 11.17-mm, respectively, which were comparable to that of penicillin sodium with ZOI of 13.15-mm. Furthermore, metabolite 1 showed moderate cytotoxicity against melanoma cell line A375 and gastric cancer cell line MGC-803, with IC50 values of 22.76 and 36.65-', 'Yes, context: In the search for new antibiotic compounds, fractionation of Pseudomonas protegens UP46 culture extracts afforded several known Pseudomonas compounds, including 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), as well as two new antibacterial alkaloids, 6-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)DAPG (1) and 6-(piperidin-2-yl)DAPG (2). The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to have antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (2 and 4-Î14g ml-1, respectively, for 1, and 2) against all tested Gram-negative bacteria, were >32-Î14g ml-1. The half maximum inhibitory concentrations against HepG2 cells for compounds 1 and 2 were 11 and 18-', 'No, context: Thermorubin (THB) is a long-known broad-spectrum ribosome-targeting antibiotic, but the molecular mechanism of its action was unclear. Here, our precise fast-kinetics assays in a reconstituted Escherichia coli translation system and 1.96-... resolution cryo-EM structure of THB-bound 70S ribosome with mRNA and initiator tRNA, independently suggest that THB binding at the intersubunit bridge B2a near decoding center of the ribosome interferes with the binding of A-site substrates aminoacyl-tRNAs and class-I release factors, thereby inhibiting elongation and termination steps of bacterial translation. Furthermore, THB acts as an anti-dissociation agent that tethers the ribosome subunits and blocks ribosome recycling, subsequently reducing the pool of active ribosomes. This in-depth characterization will hopefully spur efforts toward the design of THB analogs with improved solubility and effectivity against multidrug-resistant', 'Yes', \"Yes, context: The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance highlights the urgent need for new antibiotics. Organoarsenicals have been used as antimicrobials since Paul Ehrlich's salvarsan. Recently a soil bacterium was shown to produce the organoarsenical arsinothricin. We demonstrate that arsinothricin, a non-proteinogenic analog of glutamate that inhibits glutamine synthetase, is an effective broad-spectrum antibiotic against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that bacteria have evolved the ability to utilize the pervasive environmental toxic metalloid arsenic to produce a potent antimicrobial. With every new antibiotic, resistance inevitably arises.\", 'Yes', 'Yes, context: We report eight chimeric medermycin-type natural products with unusual polycyclic skeletons. The formation of these compounds features some key nonenzymatic steps, which inspired us to construct complex polycyclic skeletons via three efficient one-step reactions under mild conditions. This strategy was further developed to efficiently synthesize analogues for biological activity studies. The synthetic compounds, chimedermycins L and M, and sekgranaticin B, show potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. This work paves the way for understanding the nonenzymatic formation of complex natural products and using it to synthesize natural product derivatives.', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: There is a reference to antimicrobial activity.', 'Yes, context: dynobactin A is a novel peptide antibiotic from Photorhabdus australis containing two unlinked rings. It is structurally unrelated to darobactins, but also targets BamA. Based on a BamA-dynobactin co-crystal structure and a BAM-complex-dynobactin cryo-EM structure, we show that dynobactin binds to the BamA lateral gate, uniquely protruding into its Î2-barrel lumen. This study demonstrates the utility of computational approaches to antibiotic discovery and suggests that dynobactin is a promising lead for drug development.', 'No, context: Despite the wide availability of antibiotics, infectious diseases remain a leading cause of death worldwide. In the absence of new therapies, mortality rates due to untreatable infections are predicted to rise more than tenfold by 2050. Natural products made by cultured bacteria have been a major source of clinically useful antibiotics. In spite of decades of productivity, the use of bacteria in the search for new antibiotics was largely abandoned due to high rediscovery rates2,3. As only a fraction of bacterial diversity is regularly cultivated in the laboratory and just a fraction of the chemistries encoded by cultured bacteria are detected in fermentation experiments, most bacterial NPs remain hidden in the global microbiome. In an effort to access these hidden NPs, we have developed a culture-independent NP discovery platform that involves sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and heterologous expression of biosynthetic', 'Yes, context: In this study, we demonstrated that metabolic fluorescent staining of growing cell walls is a powerful tool for mode-of-action analyses of antibiotics using Streptococcus pyogenes. A set of major cell-wall-inhibiting antibiotics (bacitracin, D-cycloserine, flavomycin, oxacillin, ramoplanin, and vancomycin) was employed to validate the potential of the assay. The mechanistic differences of these antibiotics were successfully observed. For instance, D-cycloserine treatment induced fluorescently stained, excessive peripheral cell wall growth. This may indicate that the switch from the peripheral growth stage to the succeeding septal growth was disturbed by the treatment. We then applied this assay to analyze a series of vancomycin derivatives. The assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect the effects of single-site', 'Yes', 'No, context: The escalating crisis of multidrug resistance is raising the fear of untreatable Gram-negative infections and killing a substantial number of patients. The underpopulated antibiotic drug development pipelines drive polymyxins (polymyxin B and colistin) as crucial therapeutic options. However, the cumbersome synthesis process and inefficient cyclization method limit the efficient preparation of polymyxin core scaffolds in the development of polymyxin derivatives. Here, we innovatively applied a substitution reaction between bromobenzene and sulfhydryl to cyclize colistin core scaffolds. The reaction was mild and efficient, improving the total yield of the compound from less than 10% to 55.90%. Nearly 30 novel derivatives with thioether bond-mediated cyclization scaffolds were designed and synthesized. Evaluation of antibacterial activities and biological properties revealed that many new compounds that are stable in mouse plasma possess high antimicrobial potency against Gram-negative', 'No, context: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The present work reports the design and synthesis of a hybrid of the precursors of rifampicin and clofazimine, which led to the discovery of a novel Rifaphenazine (RPZ) molecule with potent anti-TB activity.

The bacterial natural product colistin is considered the last line of defence against a number of Gram-negative pathogens. The recent global spread of the plasmid-borne mobilized colistin-resistance gene mcr-1 (phosphoethanolamine transferase) threatens the usefulness of colistin3. Bacteria-derived antibiotics often appear in nature as collections of similar structures that are encoded by evolutionaryally related biosynthetic gene clusters. This structural diversity is, at least in part, expected to be a response to the development of natural resistance, which often mechanistically mimics clinical resistance. Here we propose that a solution to mcr-1-mediated resistance might have evolved among naturally occurring colistin congeners.', 'Yes', 'No, this study revealed the therapeutic potency of a novel hybrid peptide, and supported the use of rational design in development of new antibacterial agents.', 'No, context: Antibiotics with novel targets are greatly needed. Bacteria have numerous essential functions, but only a small fraction of these processes are inhibited by current drugs. Targeting metabolic enzymes has been the focus of recent interest, but effective inhibitors have been difficult to identify. We present a synthetic azetidine derivative, BRD4592, that kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis through allosteric inhibition of tryptophan synthase (TrpAB), a previously untargeted, highly allosterically regulated enzyme. This work highlights the effectiveness of allosteric inhibition for targeting proteins that are naturally highly dynamic and that are essential in vivo, despite their apparent dispensability under in vitro conditions. This work suggests a framework for the discovery of a next generation of allosteric inhibitors', 'No, context: The dearth of new medicines effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a growing global public health concern1. For more than five decades, the search for new antibiotics has relied heavily on the chemical modification of natural products (semisynthesis) a method ill-equipped to combat rapidly evolving resistance threats. Semisynthetic modifications are typically of limited scope within polyfunctional antibiotics, usually increase molecular weight, and seldom permit modifications of the underlying scaffold. When properly designed, fully synthetic routes can easily address these shortcomings2. Here we report the structure-guided design and component-based synthesis of a rigid oxepanoproline scaffold which, when linked to the aminooctose residue of clindamycin, produces an antibiotic of exceptional potency and spectrum of activity, which we name iboxamycin.', 'Yes', 'No, antibiotics are not used against biofilm, parasites, protozoans, viruses, fungal or bacterial.', 'Yes', 'No, context: The emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious global problem which requires the development of new effective antimicrobial therapeutics. Albicidin produced by the sugarcane pathogen Xanthomonas albilineans is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor with inhibitory effects significantly better than most DNA gyrase inhibitors. Albicidin acts primarily by inhibiting the religation of the cleaved DNA intermediate during the gyrase catalytic sequence similar to quinolones.

Here, our precise fast-kinetics assays in a reconstituted Escherichia coli translation system and 1.96-... resolution cryo-EM structure of THB-bound 70S ribosome with mRNA and initiator tRNA, independently suggest that THB binding at the intersubunit bridge B2a near decoding center of the ribosome interferes with the binding of A-site substrates aminoacyl-tRNAs and class-I release factors, thereby inhibiting elongation and termination steps of bacterial translation. Furthermore, THB acts as an anti-dissociation agent that tethers the ribosome subunits and blocks ribosome recycling, subsequently reducing the pool of active ribosomes.

Application of the GPAHex platform results in (1) a 19-fold increase of corbomycin titer compared to the parental strain, (2) the discovery of a teicoplanin-class GPA from an Amycolatopsis isolate, and (3) the overproduction and characterization of a cryptic nonapeptide GPA.', 'No, context: Clostridioides difficile is an enteric pathogen responsible for causing debilitating diarrhea, mostly in hospitalized patients.

Cationic peptides represent a large family of antibiotics and have attracted interest due to their diverse chemical structures and potential for combating drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Here, we analyze 7395 bacterial genomes to investigate their capacity for biosynthesis of cationic nonribosomal peptides with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Applying this approach, we identify two novel compounds (brevicidine and laterocidine) showing bactericidal activities against antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli, and an apparently low risk of resistance. The two peptides show efficacy against E. coli in a mouse thigh infection model. These findings may contribute to the discovery and development of Gram-negative antibiotics.\",\n          \"The present report describes our efforts to identify new structural classes of compounds having promising antibacterial activity using previously published double-reporter system pDualrep2. This semi-automated high-throughput screening (HTS) platform has been applied to perform a large-scale screen of a diverse small-molecule compound library. We have selected a set of more than 125,000 molecules and evaluated them for their antibacterial activity. On the basis of HTS results, eight compounds containing 2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazole scaffold exhibited moderate-to-high activity against \\u00ce\\u201dTolC Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these molecules were in the range of 0.037-8-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1. The most active compound 8 demonstrated high antibacterial potency (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20300.037-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1), that significantly exceed that measured for erythromycin (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20302.5-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1) and was comparable with the activity of levofloxacin (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20300.016-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1). Unfortunately, this compound showed only moderate selectivity toward HEK293 eukaryotic cell line. On the contrary, compound 7 was less potent (MIC-\\u2030=-\\u20300.8-\\u2030\\u00ce\\u00bcg-\\u2030ml-1) but displayed only slight cytotoxicity. Thus, 2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazoles can be considered as a valuable starting point for subsequent optimization and morphing.\",\n          \"Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus colonize similar niches in mammals and conceivably compete for space and nutrients. Here, we report that a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus chromogenes ATCC43764, synthesizes and secretes 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a purine analog that suppresses S. aureus growth by inhibiting de novo purine biosynthesis. We identify a 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes and other coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis, S. pseudintermedius and S. capitis. Recombinant S. aureus strains harbouring this operon produce 6-TG and, when used in subcutaneous co-infections in mice with virulent S. aureus USA300, protect the host from necrotic lesion formation. Used prophylactically, 6-TG reduces necrotic skin lesions in mice infected with USA300, and this effect is mediated by abrogation of toxin production. RNAseq analyses reveal that 6-TG downregulates expression of genes coding for purine biosynthesis, the accessory gene regulator (agr) and ribosomal proteins in S. aureus, providing an explanation for its effect on toxin production.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PubTator_simplified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 79,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['brevicidine', 'Cationic peptides', 'laterocidine']\",\n          \"['2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazole', '2-pyrazol-1-yl-thiazoles', 'erythromycin', 'levofloxacin']\",\n          \"['purine', '6-thioguanine', '6-TG']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"T5_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<pad> no</s>\",\n          \"<pad> yes</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ALPACA_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes, context: This report describes our efforts to identify new structural classes of compounds having promising antibacterial activity using previously published double-reporter system pDualrep2.

Targeting metabolic enzymes has been the focus of recent interest, but effective inhibitors have been difficult to identify. We demonstrate that BRD4592, a synthetic azetidine derivative, that kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis through allosteric inhibition of tryptophan synthase (TrpAB), a previously untargeted, highly allosterically regulated enzyme, is required for the survival of Mtb and Mycobacterium marinum in vivo and that this requirement may be independent of an adaptive immune response.
