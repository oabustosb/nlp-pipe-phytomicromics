The databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central were used to identify comparative trials of cefazolin vs. ASP in MSSA bacteraemia. Meta-analysis of included trials was performed to assess any differences regarding mortality, clinical cure, recurrence and withdrawal from adverse effects between groups. Data were analysed using fixed effect model. Studies were weighted using Mantel-Haenszel methodology. Heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. Nine retrospective and one prospective trials were identified involving 4728 patients, 2954 with ASP and 1774 with cefazolin. Meta-analysis showed a lower mortality rate with cefazolin vs. ASP using fixed effect model [risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.88, P\\u00c2\\u00a0<\\u00c2\\u00a00.0001] with borderline high heterogeneity (I2 \\u00c2\\u00a0=\\u00c2\\u00a051%). Clinical cure was noted more often with cefazolin (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, P\\u00c2\\u00a0=\\u00c2\\u00a00.02), although no difference was noted with relapse (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96-1.74 P\\u00c2\\u00a0=\\u00c2\\u00a00.09). Analysis also showed more withdrawals from adverse events with ASP vs. cefazolin (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.47, P\\u00c2\\u00a0<\\u00c2\\u00a00.00001). A minority of patients enrolled in these trials were admitted to the intensive care unit or had endocarditis (11.4% with ASP and 9% with cefazolin). Our meta-analysis of retrospective data demonstrate that cefazolin is more effective and safer ASP in patients with MSSA bacteraemia from various causes. Low quality of trials, borderline high heterogeneity, and possible publication bias may limit the validity of our findings. Randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.\",\n          \"The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.\",\n          \"The pharmacology of a new antibiotic methicillin, 6(2:6-dimethoxybenzamido)-penicillanic acid, which is effective against staphylococci resistant to penicillin G, has been investigated. It is free from acute and chronic toxic effects, except that some pain may be caused following intramuscular injection. It is poorly absorbed orally, but after intramuscular injection the concentrations in the serum and in tissues are very similar to those found with penicillin G. It is excreted by the kidneys both by renal tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. It is also excreted in the bile in very high concentrations, the ratio of concentration in the bile to the blood being approximately 2.5 times that of penicillin G. From a study of the metabolism of the drug it is calculated that 75% is eliminated unchanged in the urine and that the remainder is probably destroyed after the excretion into the intestine via the bile.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n

The structural relationship to daptomycin and the excellent antibacterial performance of friulimicin make the antibiotic an attractive drug candidate. The complete friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of 24 open reading frames from A. friuliensis was sequenced and analyzed. In addition to genes for regulation, self-resistance, and transport, the cluster contains genes encoding peptide synthetases, proteins involved in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of the antibiotic, and proteins involved in the synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acids pipecolinic acid, methylaspartic acid, and 2,3-diaminobutyric acid.', 'Yes, context: Cefmenoxime has high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin.

The electrophoretic patterns of the four strains (PH20610, PH20815, PH4011, and PH4301) were found to be different from those of a wild-type strain, P. aeruginosa NCTC 10662, and appeared to lack penicillin-binding protein 2. Affinity of other penicillin-binding proteins from strains PH4011 and PH4301 had more profound differences, since the affinities of their penicillin-binding proteins 1a, 1b, and 4 for carbenicillin were decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to the preparations from the wild-type strain.

This family of compounds has a 4-hydroxy-8-methylcoumarin core substituted in the 7 and 3 positions. Important for enzyme inhibition in vitro is a 7 ether linkage to a 3'-substituted noviose sugar.

The cardiotoxicity of thioridazine has recently been shown to be structurally specific at a molecular level, whereas its antimicrobial properties are shared by a number of phenothiazine analogues.

As with many antibacterial drugs, resistance to the tuberactinomycins is problematic in treating tuberculosis; this makes the development of new derivatives of these antibiotics of utmost importance. To take steps towards developing new derivatives of these antibiotics, we have focused our efforts on understanding how these antibiotics are biosynthesized by the producing bacteria so that metabolic engineering of these pathways can be used to generate desired derivatives. Here we present the heterologous production of viomycin in Streptomyces lividans 1326 and the use of targeted-gene deletion as a mechanism for investigating viomycin biosynthesis as well as the generation of viomycin derivatives.', 'Yes, context: Structures have been obtained for the complexes that triacetyloleandomycin and mycalamide A form with the large ribosomal subunit of Haloarcula marismortui. Triacetyloleandomycin binds in the nascent peptide tunnel and inhibits the activity of ribosomes by blocking the growth of the nascent peptide chain. Mycalamide A binds to the E site and inhibits protein synthesis by occupying the space normally occupied by the CCA end of E-site-bound tRNAs.', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: MX-2401 is a semisynthetic calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotic (analogue of amphomycin) in preclinical development for the treatment of serious Gram-positive organisms, including antibiotic-resistant strains. In vitro and in vivo, MX-2401 demonstrates broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms, including antibiotic-resistant strains. This study indicated that although both daptomycin and MX-2401 are in the structural class of Ca2âo-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics, the latter has a different mechanism of action. This interaction resulted in inhibition, in a dose-dependent manner, of the biosynthesis of the cell wall precursors lipids I and II and the wall teichoic acid precursor lipid III, while daptomycin had no significant effect on these processes.', 'Yes, context: The rapidly increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant infections and the alarmingly low rate of discovery of conventional antibiotics create an urgent need for alternative strategies to treat bacterial infections. Host defence peptides are short cationic molecules produced by the immune systems of most multicellular organisms; they are a class of compounds being actively researched. Strategies for creating artificial derivatives with improved biological and pharmacological properties, issues of microbial resistance, and challenges associated with their adaptation for clinical use are discussed.', 'No, context: Capreomycin and viomycin are cyclic peptide antibiotics which are particularly active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including multidrug resistant strains. Both antibiotics bind across the ribosomal interface involving 23S rRNA helix 69 (H69) and 16S rRNA helix 44 (h44). The binding site of tuberactinomycins in h44 partially overlaps with that of aminoglycosides, and they share with these drugs the side effect of irreversible hearing loss. Here we studied the drug target interaction on ribosomes modified by site-directed mutagenesis. We identified rRNA residues in h44 as the main determinants of phylogenetic selectivity, predict compensatory evolution to impact future resistance development, and propose mechanisms involved in tuberactinomycin ototoxicity, which may enable the development of improved, less-toxic derivatives.', 'Yes, context: There is a reference to antibacterial activity.', 'Yes, context: To review the literature and develop evidence-based guidelines for the use of the antibiotic clindamycin, a search of the MEDLINE database for randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and review articles that examine the therapeutic use or potential adverse effects of clindamycin was undertaken for the years 1966 to 1996. Relevant citations obtained from the references cited in the identified reviews, book chapters and antibiotic guidelines were included. Selected articles examining the indications for or adverse effects from the prophylactic or therapeutic use of clindamycin were selected. A level of evidence was assigned to the indication according to published criteria.', 'No, context: Rhodococcus equi, the causal agent of rhodococcosis, is a severe pathogen of foals but also of immunodeficient humans, causing bronchopneumonia. The peptides led to growth inhibition and death of R. equi and S. zooepidemicus at low micromolar concentrations. Moreover, eCATH1 was able to inhibit growth of K. pneumoniae. Both peptides caused rapid disruption of the R. equi membrane, leading to cell lysis. Furthermore, eCATH1 had a synergic effect together with rifampin. Furthermore, eCATH1 was not cytotoxic against mammalian cells at bacteriolytic concentrations and maintained its high killing activity even at physiological salt concentrations.', 'No, context: Our goal is to discover new agents that restore the activity of Î2-lactams against MRSA, an approach that has led to the discovery of two classes of natural product antibiotics, a cyclic depsipeptide (krisynomycin) and a lipoglycopeptide (actinocarbasin), which potentiate the activity of imipenem against MRSA strain COL. We report here that these imipenem synergists are inhibitors of the bacterial type I signal peptidase SpsB, a serine protease that is required for the secretion of proteins that are exported through the sec and Tat systems. A synthetic derivative of actinocarbasin, M131, synergized with', 'No, context: beta-lactamases constitute the major defense mechanism of pathogenic bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. When the beta-lactam ring of this antibiotic class is hydrolyzed, antimicrobial activity is destroyed. Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteract this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases.', 'No, context: Muraminomicin is a lipopeptidyl nucleoside antibiotic produced by Streptosporangium amethystogenes SANK 60709. Similar to several members of this antibiotic family such as A-90289 and muraymycin, the structure of muraminomicin consists of two modified ribose units linked by an O-Î2(1 â’ 5) glycosidic bond; however, muraminomicin holds the distinction in that both ribose units are 2-deoxy sugars. The biosynthetic gene cluster of muraminomicin has been identified, cloned and sequenced, and bioinformatic analysis revealed a minimum of 24 open reading frames putatively involved in the biosynthesis, resistance, and regulation of muraminomicin. Fives enzymes are likely involved in the assembly and attachment of the 2,5-', 'No, context: Gram-negative bacteria cause approximately 70% of the infections in intensive care units. A growing number of bacterial isolates responsible for these infections are resistant to currently available antibiotics and to many in development. Most agents under development are modifications of existing drug classes, which only partially overcome existing resistance mechanisms. Therefore, new classes of Gram-negative antibacterials with truly novel modes of action are needed to circumvent these existing resistance mechanisms. We have recently identified a new boron-based antibiotic class, the aminomethylbenzoxaboroles, which inhibit bacterial leucyl-tRNA synthetase and have activity against Gram-negative bacteria by largely evading the main efflux mechanisms in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This novel boron-based antibacterial, AN3365, has good mouse pharmacokinetics and was efficacious against', 'Yes, context: Streptomyces purpurascens has antimicrobial activity.', 'No, context: Cephapirin, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin derivative, was found to have an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of cephalothin. Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by cephapirin concentrations of 0.09 to 12.5 mug/ml. S. epidermidis, S. viridans, S. pyogenes, and Diplococcus pneumonia isolates were inhibited by less than 1 mug/ml. The Enterococcus required a concentration of 25 mug of antibiotic per ml for inhibition. Approximately 65% of Escherichia coli, and all Klebsiella, indole-negative Proteus, and Salmonella strains tested were inhibited by the drug. Serratia,', 'No, there is no reference to antimicrobial activity.', 'No, context: Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) is characterized as occurring in a minority of individuals exposed to a drug, yet it accounts for as much as 17% of all cases of acute liver failure. Despite these concerns, the mechanisms underlying IDILI remain unknown. Trovafloxacin (TVX), which causes IDILI in humans, also causes hepatocellular death in vitro when combined with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this toxicity are not fully characterized. The purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms by which TVX and TNF interact to cause cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells at drug concentrations similar to those in people undergoing TVX therapy. TVX/TNF treatment caused apoptosis and DNA damage in HepG2 cells that depended on caspase activation, and treatment with the JNK selective inhibitor SP600125 attenuated cytotoxicity.', 'No, context: Identifying the mechanism of action (MOA) of biologically active molecules under nutrient restriction is hindered by difficulties in identifying the MOA of biologically active molecules. Here we present a metabolite suppression approach to explore the MOA of antibacterial compounds under nutrient limitation. We identified inhibitors of Escherichia coli growth under nutrient limitation and charted their interactions with our metabolite array. This strategy led to the discovery and characterization of three new antibacterial compounds, MAC168425, MAC173979 and MAC13772. We concluded that metabolite suppression profiling is an effective approach to focus MOA studies on compounds impairing metabolic capabilities. These bioactives can serve as chemical probes of bacterial physiology and as leads for antibacterial drug development.', 'No, context: Bacteriophage endolysins have shown great efficacy in killing Gram-positive bacteria. However, PlyC is a unique lysin, in terms of both its high activity and structure (two distinct subunits). We sought to discover and characterize an endolysin, termed PlyPy, from a prophage infecting S. pyogenes. By in silico analysis, PlyPy was found to have a molecular mass of 27.8 kDa and a pI of 4.16. It was active against a majority of group A streptococci and displayed high levels of activity as well as binding specificity against group B and C streptococci, while it was less efficient against other streptococcal species. Additionally, PlyPy was active in vivo and could rescue mice from systemic bacteremia. Finally, we developed a novel method to determine the peptidoglycan bond cleaved by', 'Yes, background: Salinomycin has anti-cancer and anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) effects, as well as activities to overcome multi-drug resistance based on studies using human cancer cell lines, xenograft mice, and in case reports involving cancer patients in pilot clinical trials. This review summarizes the pharmacologic effects of salinomycin and presents possible mechanisms by which salinomycin exerts its anti-tumorigenic activities. Recent advances and potential complications that might limit the utilization of salinomycin as an anti-cancer and anti-CSC agent are also presented and discussed.', 'Yes, context: Furazolidone-based triple and quadruple therapy in eradicating Helicobacter pylori in a multi-center randomized controlled trial. Patients in Groups 1 and 3 received rabeprazole (10 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg) and furazolidone (100 mg) twice daily for 7 and 10 d, respectively; patients in Groups 2 and 4 received rabeprazole (10 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg) and furazolidone (100 mg) twice daily for 7 and 10 d, respectively; and patients in Groups 3 and 4 received rabeprazole (10 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg) and furazolidone (100 mg) twice daily for 7 and 10 d, respectively. The primary outcome measure was H. pylori eradication rate 4 wk after treatment by intention-to-treat analysis, while the secondary outcome measures were symptom and sign changes at the end of treatment and 4 wk after the end of treatment.', 'Yes, context: We successfully produced two human Î2-defensins (hBD-1 and hBD-2) in bacteria as functional peptides and tested their antibacterial activities against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus employing both spectroscopic and viable CFU count methods. Purified peptides showed approximately 50% inhibition of the bacterial population when used individually and up to 90% when used in combination. Furthermore, we observed that bacterium-derived antimicrobial peptides were also effective in increasing survival time and decreasing bacterial loads in the peritoneal fluid, liver, and spleen of a mouse intraperitoneally infected with S. Typhi.', 'Yes', 'No, context: We studied comparatively the pharmacokinetics and tolerance of three aminoglycoside antibiotics, gentamicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin in a randomized crossover design involving 12 normal subjects. Serum concentrations were determined during 8 h and the urine recovery rate was determined within 24 h after a 1-h intravenous infusion of the respective antibiotic in a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight. Microbiological assay was performed with the agar diffusion test (Bacillus subtilis); pharmacokinetic calculations were performed by means of a digital computer on the basis of a mathematical model of an open, two-compartment system.', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: Sulbactam is a class A Î2-lactamase inhibitor with intrinsic whole-cell activity against certain bacterial species, including Acinetobacter baumannii. The clinical use of sulbactam for A. baumannii infections is of interest due to increasing multidrug resistance in this pathogen. However, the molecular drivers of its antibacterial activity and resistance determinants have yet to be precisely defined. Here we show that the antibacterial activities of sulbactam vary widely across contemporary A. baumannii clinical isolates and are mediated through inhibition of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) PBP1 and PBP3 with very low frequency of resistance; the rare pbp3 mutants with high levels of resistance to sulbactam are attenuated in fitness.', 'Yes, context: Cefozopran is a parenteral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cefozopran after single- and multiple-dose intravenous administration in healthy subjects, to provide clinical guidance in its application. This was a single-center, open-label, randomized, two-phase study conducted in 12 subjects.', 'No, context: Two new antimetabolites of biotin were isolated from culture filters of Streptomyces lydicus: beta-methyldethiobiotin and beta-methylbiotin. (14)C-biotin or (14)C-pimelic acid was not incorporated into either of these antimetabolites by the growing culture. Neither of the compounds could substitute for the biotin requirement in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both compounds had a strong and rather specific antimicrobial effect against mycobacteria. Their antimicrobial activities were reversed by biotin. Both compounds had an affinity for avidin.', 'No, context: The sulfur-containing antibiotic thiolutin has been shown to be a potent, reversible inhibitor of the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Viability was unaffected over the concentration range of 4 to 100 mug/ml. At concentrations as low as 2 mug/ml, the drug inhibited ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein synthesis in whole cells and spheroplasts. At these low concentrations, protein synthesis continued for a short period of time after RNA synthesis was completely stopped. With higher concentrations of thiolutin up to 100 mug/ml did not affect translocation or peptide bond formation in cell-free protein-synthesizing systems from yeast.', 'Yes', 'Yes, the prodrug TXA709 has improved pharmacokinetics and improved oral efficacy against both methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: We have recently revealed the discovery of the class of 1,2,4-oxadiazole antibiotics, which emerged from in silico docking and scoring efforts. This class of antibiotics exhibits Gram-positive activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus. We define the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this class of antibiotics with the synthesis and evaluation of a series of 59 derivatives with variations in the C ring or C and D rings. A total of 17 compounds showed activity against S. aureus. Four derivatives were evaluated against a panel of 16 Gram-positive strains, inclusive of several methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. These compounds are broadly active against Gram-positive bacteria.', \"No, context: The antibiotic spectinomycin is a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis with a unique mechanism of action and an excellent safety index, but it lacks antibacterial activity against most clinically important pathogens. A series of N-benzyl-substituted 3'-(R)-3'-aminomethyl-3'-hydroxy spectinomycins was developed on the basis of a computational analysis of the aminomethyl spectinomycin binding site and structure-guided synthesis. These compounds had ribosomal inhibition values comparable to spectinomycin but showed increased potency against the common respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as the sexually transmitted bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.\", 'Yes, context: Enoyl-ACP reductase is the molecular target for several successful antibiotics such as the tuberculosis therapeutic isoniazid. It is currently under investigation as a narrow-spectrum antibiotic target for the treatment of several types of bacterial infections. The diazaborine family is a group of boron heterocycle-based synthetic antibacterial inhibitors known to target enoyl-ACP reductase. Development of this class of molecules has thus far focused solely on the sulfonyl-containing versions. Here, the requirement for the sulfonyl group in the diazaborine scaffold was investigated by examining several recently characterized enoyl-ACP reductase inhibitors that lack the sulfonyl group and exhibit additional variability in substitutions, size and flexibility.', 'Yes', 'Yes, context: Trimethoprim is a synthetic compound which arrests the step in bacterial purine synthesis immediately succeeding that interfered with by sulphonamides. Its action with a sulphonamide is strongly synergic and bactericidal. Studies are described of suitable cultural conditions, methods of testing sensitivity, and acquired resistance. Some clinical results of its use are reported in respiratory tract infections, Gram-negative septicaemia, and urinary tract infections, and further therapeutic possibilities are discussed.', 'Yes, context: Many approaches are used to discover new antibiotic compounds, one of the most widespread being the chemical modification of known antibiotics. This type of discovery has been so important in the development of new antibiotics that most antibiotics used today belong to the same chemical classes as antibiotics discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. Even though the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, the chemical modification of antibiotics in known classes is still widely used to discover new antibiotics, resulting in a great number of compounds in the discovery and clinical pipeline that belong to existing classes.', 'Yes', 'Yes, ertapenem appears as effective as other carbapenems for empirical and targeted therapy of BSI due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.', 'No, context: Quinolones are potent antimicrobial agents with a basic chemical structure of bicyclic ring. Fluorine atom at position C-6 and various substitutions on the basic quinolone structure yielded fluoroquinolones, namely Norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and numerous other agents. The target molecules of quinolones and fluoroquinolones are bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. Broad-spectrum and excellent tissue penetration make fluoroquinolones potent agents but their toxic side effects and increasing number of resistant pathogens set limits on their use.

GPI0363, a novel spiro-heterocyclic compound, was bacteriostatic and inhibited RNA synthesis in S. aureus cells. GPI0363-resistant S. aureus strains harbored a point mutation in the gene encoding the primary sigma factor, SigA, of RNA polymerase, and this mutation was responsible for the resistance to GPI0363.

Polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales. Polymyxins were first discovered in the late 1940s but were abandoned soon after their approval in the late 1950s as a result of toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity) and the availability of \"safer\" antibiotics approved at that time. Therefore, knowledge on polymyxins had been scarce until recently, when enormous efforts have been made by several research teams around the world to elucidate the chemical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and toxicological properties of polymyxins.', 'Yes, context: Multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are an increasing public health threat due to rapidly rising resistance toward Î2-lactam antibiotics. The hydrolytic enzymes called Î2-lactamases are responsible for a large proportion of the resistance phenotype. Î2-Lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) can be administered in combination with Î2-lactam antibiotics to negate the action of the Î2-lactamases, thereby restoring activity of the Î2-lactam. Newly developed BLIs offer some advantage over older BLIs in terms of enzymatic spectrum but are limited to the intravenous route of administration.

Our salvation lies in circumventing the genesis of resistance. Considering the competitive advantages of antibacterial chemotherapeutic agents equipped with multiple warheads against resistance, the development of hybrids has rejuvenated. The adoption of antibiotic hybrid paradigm to macrocycles has advanced novel chemical entities to clinical trials.

The increasing emergence of Î2-lactamase-producing multi-drug-resistant \"superbugs\" has resulted in increases in costly hospital Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations due to the requirement for parenteral antibiotic therapy for infections caused by these difficult-to-treat bacteria. To address the lack of outpatient treatment, we initiated an iterative program combining medicinal chemistry, biochemical testing, microbiological profiling, and evaluation of oral pharmacokinetics.

Importantly, we identify G2824 as the first-described Lgt inhibitor that potently inhibits Lgt biochemical activity in vitro and is bactericidal against wild-type Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli strains. While deletion of a gene encoding a major outer membrane lipoprotein lpp leads to rescue of bacterial growth after genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream type II signal peptidase, LspA, no such rescue of growth is detected after Lgt depletion or treatment with G2824.', 'Yes, context: We trained a deep neural network capable of predicting molecules with antibacterial activity. We performed predictions on multiple chemical libraries and discovered a molecule from the Drug Repurposing Hub-halicin-that is structurally divergent from conventional antibiotics and displays bactericidal activity against a wide phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

Although many representatives were withdrawn due to severe adverse reactions, a few representatives have proven their therapeutical value over time. The classification of antibacterial quinolones into generations is a valuable tool for physicians, pharmacists, and researchers. In addition, the transition from one generation to another has brought new representatives with improved properties. In the last two decades, several representatives of antibacterial quinolones received approval for therapy. This review sets out to chronologically outline the group of approved antibacterial quinolones since 2000.

New classes of antimicrobial compounds are urgently needed as the frequency of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microbes continues to rise. Recent metagenomic data have demonstrated that there is still biosynthetic potential encoded in but transcriptionally silent in cultivatable bacterial genomes. However, the culture conditions required to identify and express silent biosynthetic gene clusters that yield natural products with antimicrobial activity are largely unknown.

Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested predictions from >107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our model identified eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from known antibiotics.

Here, we establish the activity spectrum of nourseothricin and its main components, streptothricin F (S-F, 1 lysine) and streptothricin D (S-D, 3 lysines), purified to homogeneity, against highly drug-resistant, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii. In vivo, delayed kidney toxicity occurred at >10-fold higher doses of S-F compared with S-D. Substantial treatment effect of S-F in the murine thigh model was observed against the otherwise pandrug-resistant, NDM-1-expressing Klebsiella pneumoniae Nevada strain with minimal or no toxicity.', 'No, the antibiotic sodium pseudomonate is a powerful competitive inhibitor of Escherichia coli B isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.', 'No, context: The efficacy of telavancin was compared to that of vancomycin and linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a murine pneumonia model. The efficacy of telavancin produced greater reductions in lung bacterial titer and mortality than that of vancomycin and linezolid at human doses equivalent to those described by the area under the concentration-time curve. These results suggest the potential utility of telavancin for treatment of MRSA pneumonia.', 'Yes, methicillin, 6(2:6-dimethoxybenzamido)-penicillanic acid, which is effective against staphylococci resistant to penicillin G, has been investigated. It is poorly absorbed orally, but after intramuscular injection the concentrations in the serum and in tissues are very similar to those found with penicillin G.

One approach to counteract this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases.

The clinical use of sulbactam for A. baumannii infections is of interest due to increasing multidrug resistance in this pathogen. However, the molecular drivers of its antibacterial activity and resistance determinants have yet to be precisely defined. Here we show that the antibacterial activities of sulbactam vary widely across contemporary A. baumannii clinical isolates and are mediated through inhibition of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) PBP1 and PBP3 with very low frequency of resistance.

The databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central were used to identify comparative trials of cefazolin vs. ASP in MSSA bacteraemia. Meta-analysis of included trials was performed to assess any differences regarding mortality, clinical cure, recurrence and withdrawal from adverse effects between groups. Data were analysed using fixed effect model. Studies were weighted using Mantel-Haenszel methodology. Heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. Nine retrospective and one prospective trials were identified involving 4728 patients, 2954 with ASP and 1774 with cefazolin. Meta-analysis showed a lower mortality rate with cefazolin vs. ASP using fixed effect model [risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.88, P\\u00c2\\u00a0<\\u00c2\\u00a00.0001] with borderline high heterogeneity (I2 \\u00c2\\u00a0=\\u00c2\\u00a051%). Clinical cure was noted more often with cefazolin (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, P\\u00c2\\u00a0=\\u00c2\\u00a00.02), although no difference was noted with relapse (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96-1.74 P\\u00c2\\u00a0=\\u00c2\\u00a00.09). Analysis also showed more withdrawals from adverse events with ASP vs. cefazolin (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.47, P\\u00c2\\u00a0<\\u00c2\\u00a00.00001). A minority of patients enrolled in these trials were admitted to the intensive care unit or had endocarditis (11.4% with ASP and 9% with cefazolin). Our meta-analysis of retrospective data demonstrate that cefazolin is more effective and safer ASP in patients with MSSA bacteraemia from various causes. Low quality of trials, borderline high heterogeneity, and possible publication bias may limit the validity of our findings. Randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.\",\n          \"The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.\",\n          \"The pharmacology of a new antibiotic methicillin, 6(2:6-dimethoxybenzamido)-penicillanic acid, which is effective against staphylococci resistant to penicillin G, has been investigated. It is free from acute and chronic toxic effects, except that some pain may be caused following intramuscular injection. It is poorly absorbed orally, but after intramuscular injection the concentrations in the serum and in tissues are very similar to those found with penicillin G. It is excreted by the kidneys both by renal tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. It is also excreted in the bile in very high concentrations, the ratio of concentration in the bile to the blood being approximately 2.5 times that of penicillin G. From a study of the metabolism of the drug it is calculated that 75% is eliminated unchanged in the urine and that the remainder is probably destroyed after the excretion into the intestine via the bile.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 112,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['sulbactam', 'cp-45,899', 'beta-lactamase inhibitor (penicillanic acid sulfone)']\",\n          \"['cefprozil', 'beta-lactam (cephalosporin, second generation)']\",\n          \"['methicillin', 'meticillin', 'beta-lactam (penicillin)']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"T5_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<pad> no</s>\",\n          \"<pad> yes</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ALPACA_Q1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No, context: The evolution of the class of antibacterial quinolones includes the introduction in therapy of highly successful compounds.
