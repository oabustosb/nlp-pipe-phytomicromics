Activity against S. aureus was less than that of cephapirin, cephalothin, and cefazolin, but greater than that of cephalexin. Activity against gram-negative isolates was variable: BL-S640 was slightly less potent than cefazolin against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, but more active than the other compounds. As for the more resistant gram-negative genera, BL-S640 was significantly superior to the control cephalosporins. The effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity was moderate for most organisms except Enterobacter, Providencia stuartii, and indole-positive Proteus, the median minimal inhibitory concentrations of which were 6 to 27 times lower when determined with a 10(-4)-diluted culture compared with the undiluted one. The stability in aqueous solution at 37 C was remarkably high at the lower pH values, but low at the neutral point.\",\n          \"beta-Lactamases constitute the major defense mechanism of pathogenic bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. When the beta-lactam ring of this antibiotic class is hydrolyzed, antimicrobial activity is destroyed. Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteracting this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Both of these molecules eventually inactivate the target enzymes permanently. Although clavulanic acid exhibits more potent inhibitory activity than sulbactam, especially against the TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, the spectrum of inhibitory activities are very similar. Neither of these inhibitors acts as a good inhibitor of the cephalosporinases. Clavulanic acid has been most frequently combined with amoxicillin in the orally active Augmentin and with ticarcillin in the parenteral beta-lactam combination Timentin. Sulbactam has been used primarily to protect ampicillin from enzymatic hydrolysis. Sulbactam has been used either in the orally absorbed prodrug form as sultamicillin or as the injectable combination ampicillin-sulbactam. Synergy has been demonstrated for these combinations for most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, although those organisms that produce cephalosporinases are not well inhibited. Synergy has also been observed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic organisms. These antibiotic combinations have been used clinically to treat urinary tract infections, bone and soft-tissue infections, gonorrhea, respiratory infections, and otitis media. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported for Augmentin and sultamicillin; most side effects with these agents have been mild. Although combination therapy with beta-lactamase inactivators has been used successfully, the problem of resistance development to two agents must be considered. Induction of cephalosporinases can occur with clavulanic acid. Permeability mutants could arise, especially with added pressure from a second beta-lactam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\",\n          \"A tyrothricin concentration of 0.01 mg. per ml. causes rapid lysis of Staphylococcus aureus; this lyric action is not enhanced by phage. A concentration of 0.001 mg. per ml. of tyrothricin is likewise capable of lysing staphylococci, and the addition of phage does not appreciably alter the rate of lysis. A concentration of 0.0001 mg. per ml. of tyrothricin is unable to effect lysis though it enhances the lytic activity of phage.

Activity against S. aureus was less than that of cephapirin, cephalothin, and cefazolin, but greater than that of cephalexin. Activity against gram-negative isolates was variable: BL-S640 was slightly less potent than cefazolin against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, but more active than the other compounds. As for the more resistant gram-negative genera, BL-S640 was significantly superior to the control cephalosporins. The effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity was moderate for most organisms except Enterobacter, Providencia stuartii, and indole-positive Proteus, the median minimal inhibitory concentrations of which were 6 to 27 times lower when determined with a 10(-4)-diluted culture compared with the undiluted one. The stability in aqueous solution at 37 C was remarkably high at the lower pH values, but low at the neutral point.\",\n          \"beta-Lactamases constitute the major defense mechanism of pathogenic bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. When the beta-lactam ring of this antibiotic class is hydrolyzed, antimicrobial activity is destroyed. Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteracting this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Both of these molecules eventually inactivate the target enzymes permanently. Although clavulanic acid exhibits more potent inhibitory activity than sulbactam, especially against the TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, the spectrum of inhibitory activities are very similar. Neither of these inhibitors acts as a good inhibitor of the cephalosporinases. Clavulanic acid has been most frequently combined with amoxicillin in the orally active Augmentin and with ticarcillin in the parenteral beta-lactam combination Timentin. Sulbactam has been used primarily to protect ampicillin from enzymatic hydrolysis. Sulbactam has been used either in the orally absorbed prodrug form as sultamicillin or as the injectable combination ampicillin-sulbactam. Synergy has been demonstrated for these combinations for most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, although those organisms that produce cephalosporinases are not well inhibited. Synergy has also been observed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic organisms. These antibiotic combinations have been used clinically to treat urinary tract infections, bone and soft-tissue infections, gonorrhea, respiratory infections, and otitis media. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported for Augmentin and sultamicillin; most side effects with these agents have been mild. Although combination therapy with beta-lactamase inactivators has been used successfully, the problem of resistance development to two agents must be considered. Induction of cephalosporinases can occur with clavulanic acid. Permeability mutants could arise, especially with added pressure from a second beta-lactam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\",\n          \"A tyrothricin concentration of 0.01 mg. per ml. causes rapid lysis of Staphylococcus aureus; this lyric action is not enhanced by phage. A concentration of 0.001 mg. per ml. of tyrothricin is likewise capable of lysing staphylococci, and the addition of phage does not appreciably alter the rate of lysis. A concentration of 0.0001 mg. per ml. of tyrothricin is unable to effect lysis though it enhances the lytic activity of phage.

The increasing emergence of β-lactamase-producing multi-drug-resistant \"superbugs\" has resulted in increases in costly hospital Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations due to the requirement for parenteral antibiotic therapy for infections caused by these difficult-to-treat bacteria. To address the lack of outpatient treatment, we initiated an iterative program combining medicinal chemistry, biochemical testing, microbiological profiling, and evaluation of oral pharmacokinetics. Lead optimization focusing on multiple smaller, more lipophilic active compounds, followed by an exploration of oral bioavailability of a variety of their respective prodrugs, provided 36 (VNRX-7145/VNRX-5236 etzadroxil), the prodrug of the boronic acid-containing β-lactamase inhibitor 5 (VNRX-5236). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that 5 restored the activity of the oral cephalosporin antibiotic ceftibuten against Enterobacterales expressing Ambler class A extended-spectrum β-lactamases, class A carbapenemases, class C cephalosporinases, and class D oxacillinases.',\n",
              " 'A new environmental bacterial strain exhibited strong antimicrobial characteristics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus plantarum, and other Gram-positive bacteria. The producer strain, designated OSY-I1, was determined to be Brevibacillus laterosporusvia morphological, biochemical, and genetic analyses. The antimicrobial agent was extracted from cells of OSY-I1 with isopropanol, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and structurally analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The MS and NMR results, taken together, uncovered a linear lipopeptide consisting of 13 amino acids and an N-terminal C6 fatty acid (FA) chain, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid. The lipopeptide (FA-Dhb-Leu-Orn-Ile-Ile-Val-Lys-Val-Val-Lys-Tyr-Leu-valinol, where Dhb is α,β-didehydrobutyric acid and valinol is 2-amino-3-methyl-1-butanol) has a molecular mass of 1,583.0794 Da and contains three modified amino acid residues: α,β-didehydrobutyric acid, ornithine, and valinol. The compound, designated brevibacillin, was determined to be a member of a cationic lipopeptide antibiotic family. In addition to its potency against drug-resistant bacteria, brevibacillin also exhibited low MICs (1 to 8 μg/ml) against selected foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes,Bacillus cereus, and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Purified brevibacillin showed no sign of degradation when it was held at 80 °C for 60 min, and it retained at least 50% of its antimicrobial activity when it was held for 22 h under acidic or alkaline conditions. On the basis of these findings, brevibacillin is a potent antimicrobial lipopeptide which is potentially useful to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.',\n",

              " 'Actinoplanes friuliensis produces the lipopeptide antibiotic friulimicin, which is a cyclic peptide with one exocyclic amino acid linked to a branched-chain fatty acid acyl residue. The structural relationship to daptomycin and the excellent antibacterial performance of friulimicin make the antibiotic an attractive drug candidate. The complete friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of 24 open reading frames from A. friuliensis was sequenced and analyzed. In addition to genes for regulation, self-resistance, and transport, the cluster contains genes encoding peptide synthetases, proteins involved in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of the antibiotic, and proteins involved in the synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acids pipecolinic acid, methylaspartic acid, and 2,3-diaminobutyric acid. By using heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli, we provide biochemical evidence for the stereoselective synthesis of L-pipecolinic acid by the deduced protein of the lysine cyclodeaminase gene pip. Furthermore, we show the involvement of the dabA and dabB genes in the biosynthesis of 2,3-diaminobutyric acid by gene inactivation and subsequent feeding experiments.',\n",
              " 'Antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens continues to pose a serious global health threat. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of the Gram-negative organism Acinetobacter baumannii utilize a number of resistance determinants to evade current antibiotics. One of the major resistance mechanisms employed by these pathogens is the use of multidrug efflux pumps. These pumps extrude xenobiotics directly out of bacterial cells, resulting in treatment failures when common antibiotics are administered. Here, the structure of the novel tetracycline antibiotic TP-6076, bound to both the Acinetobacter drug efflux pump AdeJ and the ribosome from Acinetobacter baumannii, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), is elucidated. In this work, the structure of the AdeJ-TP-6076 complex is solved, and we show that AdeJ utilizes a network of hydrophobic interactions to recognize this fluorocycline. Concomitant with this, we elucidate three structures of TP-6076 bound to the A. baumannii ribosome and determine that its binding is stabilized largely by electrostatic interactions. We then compare the differences in binding modes between TP-6076 and the related tetracycline antibiotic eravacycline in both targets. These differences suggest that modifications to the tetracycline core may be able to alter AdeJ binding while maintaining interactions with the ribosome. Together, this work highlights how different mechanisms are used to stabilize the binding of tetracycline-based compounds to unique bacterial targets and provides guidance for the future clinical development of tetracycline antibiotics. IMPORTANCE Treatment of antibiotic-resistant organisms such as A. baumannii represents an ongoing issue for modern medicine. The multidrug efflux pump AdeJ serves as a major resistance determinant in A. baumannii through its action of extruding antibiotics from the cell. In this work, we use cryo-EM to show how AdeJ recognizes the experimental tetracycline antibiotic TP-6076 and prevents this drug from interacting with the A. baumannii ribosome. Since AdeJ and the ribosome use different binding modes to stabilize interactions with TP-6076, exploiting these differences may guide future drug development for combating antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii and potentially other strains of MDR bacteria.',\n",
              " 'Antibiotic resistance is a major global health challenge and, worryingly, several key Gram negative pathogens can become resistant to most currently available antibiotics. Polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales. Polymyxins were first discovered in the late 1940s but were abandoned soon after their approval in the late 1950s as a result of toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity) and the availability of \"safer\" antibiotics approved at that time. Therefore, knowledge on polymyxins had been scarce until recently, when enormous efforts have been made by several research teams around the world to elucidate the chemical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and toxicological properties of polymyxins. One of the major achievements is the development of the first scientifically based dosage regimens for colistin that are crucial to ensure its safe and effective use in patients. Although the guideline has not been developed for polymyxin B, a large clinical trial is currently being conducted to optimize its clinical use. Importantly, several novel, safer polymyxin-like lipopeptides are developed to overcome the nephrotoxicity, poor efficacy against pulmonary infections, and narrow therapeutic windows of the currently used polymyxin B and colistin. This review discusses the latest achievements on polymyxins and highlights the major challenges ahead in optimizing their clinical use and discovering new-generation polymyxins. To save lives from the deadly infections caused by Gram negative \"superbugs,\" every effort must be made to improve the clinical utility of the last-line polymyxins. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to global health. The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has been highlighted by leading global health organizations and authorities. Polymyxins are a last-line defense against difficult-to-treat MDR Gram negative pathogens. Unfortunately, the pharmacological information on polymyxins was very limited until recently. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the major achievements and challenges in polymyxin pharmacology and clinical use and how the recent findings have been employed to improve clinical practice worldwide.',\n",
              " 'Bacteriophage endolysins have shown great efficacy in killing Gram-positive bacteria. PlyC, a group C streptococcal phage lysin, represents the most efficient lysin characterized to date, with a remarkably high specificity against different streptococcal species, including the important pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. However, PlyC is a unique lysin, in terms of both its high activity and structure (two distinct subunits). We sought to discover and characterize a phage lysin active against S. pyogenes with an endolysin architecture distinct from that of PlyC to determine if it relies on the same mechanism of action as PlyC. In this study, we identified and characterized an endolysin, termed PlyPy (phage lysin from S. pyogenes), from a prophage infecting S. pyogenes. By in silico analysis, PlyPy was found to have a molecular mass of 27.8 kDa and a pI of 4.16. It was active against a majority of group A streptococci and displayed high levels of activity as well as binding specificity against group B and C streptococci, while it was less efficient against other streptococcal species. PlyPy showed the highest activity at neutral pH in the presence of calcium and NaCl. Surprisingly, its activity was not affected by the presence of the group A-specific carbohydrate, while the activity of PlyC was partly inhibited. Additionally, PlyPy was active in vivo and could rescue mice from systemic bacteremia. Finally, we developed a novel method to determine the peptidoglycan bond cleaved by lysins and concluded that PlyPy exhibits a rare d-alanyl-l-alanine endopeptidase activity. PlyPy thus represents the first lysin characterized from Streptococcus pyogenes and has a mechanism of action distinct from that of PlyC.',\n",
              " 'Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus agalactiae is the leading cause of bacteremia and invasive infections. These diseases are treated with β-lactams or macrolides, but the emergence of less susceptible and even fully resistant strains is a cause for concern. New bacteriophage lysins could be promising alternatives against such organisms. They hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage cycle, in order to release the phage progeny. By using a bioinformatic approach to screen several beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gene coding for a lysin was identified on a prophage carried by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis SK1249. The gene product, named PlySK1249, harbored an original three-domain structure with a central cell wall-binding domain surrounded by an N-terminal amidase and a C-terminal CHAP domain. Purified PlySK1249 was highly lytic and bactericidal for S. dysgalactiae (2-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min). Moreover, it also efficiently killed S. agalactiae (1.5-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min) but not several streptococcal commensal species. We further investigated the activity of PlySK1249 in a mouse model of S. agalactiae bacteremia. Eighty percent of the animals (n = 10) challenged intraperitoneally with 10(6) CFU of S. agalactiae died within 72 h, whereas repeated injections of PlySK1249 (45 mg/kg 3 times within 24 h) significantly protected the mice (P < 0.01). Thus, PlySK1249, which was isolated from S. dysgalactiae, demonstrated high cross-lytic activity against S. agalactiae both in vitro and in vivo. These encouraging results indicated that PlySK1249 might represent a good candidate to be developed as a new enzybiotic for the treatment of systemic S. agalactiae infections.',\n",
              " 'beta-Lactamases constitute the major defense mechanism of pathogenic bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. When the beta-lactam ring of this antibiotic class is hydrolyzed, antimicrobial activity is destroyed. Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteracting this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Both of these molecules eventually inactivate the target enzymes permanently. Although clavulanic acid exhibits more potent inhibitory activity than sulbactam, especially against the TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, the spectrum of inhibitory activities are very similar. Neither of these inhibitors acts as a good inhibitor of the cephalosporinases. Clavulanic acid has been most frequently combined with amoxicillin in the orally active Augmentin and with ticarcillin in the parenteral beta-lactam combination Timentin. Sulbactam has been used primarily to protect ampicillin from enzymatic hydrolysis. Sulbactam has been used either in the orally absorbed prodrug form as sultamicillin or as the injectable combination ampicillin-sulbactam. Synergy has been demonstrated for these combinations for most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, although those organisms that produce cephalosporinases are not well inhibited. Synergy has also been observed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic organisms. These antibiotic combinations have been used clinically to treat urinary tract infections, bone and soft-tissue infections, gonorrhea, respiratory infections, and otitis media. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported for Augmentin and sultamicillin; most side effects with these agents have been mild. Although combination therapy with beta-lactamase inactivators has been used successfully, the problem of resistance development to two agents must be considered. Induction of cephalosporinases can occur with clavulanic acid. Permeability mutants could arise, especially with added pressure from a second beta-lactam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",
              " 'Bladder cancer is one of the most frequent cancers among males, and a poor survival rate reflects problems with aggressiveness and chemo-resistance. Accumulating evidence indicates that SIRT1 is involved in bladder cancer tumorigenesis and is positively associated with chemo-resistance and poor prognosis. We recently synthesized water-soluble chemical derivatives of heliomycin, an antibiotic from Streptomyces resistomycificus, and demonstrated that they possess anticancer properties. In this present study, we used the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) in T24 bladder cancer cells to show that heliomycin (designated compound (H1)) and its 4-(tert-butylamino)methyl derivative (HD2) directly engaged with SIRT1 in the native cellular environment, whereas another derivative (HD3) did not. Upon binding, heliomycin downregulated SIRT1 protein expression without altering its transcript level, and subsequently induced autophagy. Interestingly, the derivative (HD2) triggered apoptosis. The interaction between SIRT1 protein and heliomycin or its derivatives was also speculated by a molecular docking simulation, suggesting heliomycin (H1) and derivative (HD2) acting with the different binding modes to SIRT1. Given the increased water-solubility, hydrogen bonds were found on Ala262 and Ile347 residues in the docked complex of derivative (HD2) to produce more steady interaction and initiate signaling pathways that were not observed in the case of heliomycin. Meanwhile, it is evident that derivative (HD3) did not engage with SIRT1 by CETSA or molecular docking studies, nor did it downregulate SIRT1 expression. Taken together, these findings clearly show that SIRT1 is targeted and downregulated by heliomycin and its water-soluble 4-aminomethylated derivative (HD2) possibly through autophagic and/or proteasomal degradation, leading to cell death and growth suppression of T24 bladder cancer cells.',\n",
              " 'Capreomycin and the structurally similar compound viomycin are cyclic peptide antibiotics which are particularly active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including multidrug resistant strains. Both antibiotics bind across the ribosomal interface involving 23S rRNA helix 69 (H69) and 16S rRNA helix 44 (h44). The binding site of tuberactinomycins in h44 partially overlaps with that of aminoglycosides, and they share with these drugs the side effect of irreversible hearing loss. Here we studied the drug target interaction on ribosomes modified by site-directed mutagenesis. We identified rRNA residues in h44 as the main determinants of phylogenetic selectivity, predict compensatory evolution to impact future resistance development, and propose mechanisms involved in tuberactinomycin ototoxicity, which may enable the development of improved, less-toxic derivatives.',\n",

In addition, we define the full resistance determinant for CBR703, show that the binding site and resistance determinant for CBR703 do not overlap the binding sites and resistance determinants of other characterized RNAP inhibitors, show that CBR703 exhibits no or minimal cross-resistance with other characterized RNAP inhibitors, and show that co-administration of CBR703 with other RNAP inhibitors results in additive antibacterial activities. The results set the stage for structure-based optimization of CBR inhibitors as antibacterial drugs.',\n",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cefozopran after single- and multiple-dose intravenous administration in healthy subjects, to provide clinical guidance in its application. This was a single-center, open-label, randomized, two-phase study conducted in 12 subjects. In the single-dose phase, subjects were randomly assigned to receive single doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0\\xa0g of injected cefozopran hydrochloride in a three-way crossover design with a 5-day washout period between administrations. In the multiple-dose phase, subjects received 2.0\\xa0g every 12\\xa0h for 4\\xa0days. Plasma and urine pharmacokinetic samples were assayed by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and analyzed statistically. Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study. Twelve healthy volunteers (six males and six females) were enrolled and completed the study. Following a single 1-h intravenous infusion of 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0\\xa0g cefozopran, maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUClast) increased in a dose-proportional manner. The mean half-life in plasma (t ½) was in the range of 1.20-2.80\\xa0h. Cefozopran was mainly excreted in its unchanged form, with no tendency for accumulation, via the kidney, and varied from 65.99 to 73.33\\xa0%. No appreciable accumulation of either drug occurred with multiple intravenous doses of cefozopran, and pharmacokinetic parameters for cefozopran were similar on days 1 and 4. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were generally mild.

Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by cephapirin concentrations of 0.09 to 12.5 mug/ml. S. epidermidis, S. viridans, S. pyogenes, and Diplococcus pneumonia isolates were inhibited by less than 1 mug/ml. The Enterococcus required a concentration of 25 mug of antibiotic per ml for inhibition. Approximately 65% of Escherichia coli, and all Klebsiella, indole-negative Proteus, and Salmonella strains tested were inhibited by the drug. Serratia, Pseudomonas, indole-positive Proteus, and Erwinia strains were highly resistant. Inoculum size was not an important factor in determining the level of sensitivity of S. aureus to cephapirin. The antibiotic does not appear to be significantly bound to serum protein. In vitro development of resistance to the drug was demonstrated with two isolates of S. aureus.',\n",
              " 'Characterizing new drugs and chemical probes of biological systems is hindered by difficulties in identifying the mechanism of action (MOA) of biologically active molecules. Here we present a metabolite suppression approach to explore the MOA of antibacterial compounds under nutrient restriction. We assembled an array of metabolites that can be screened for suppressors of inhibitory molecules. Further, we identified inhibitors of Escherichia coli growth under nutrient limitation and charted their interactions with our metabolite array. This strategy led to the discovery and characterization of three new antibacterial compounds, MAC168425, MAC173979 and MAC13772. We showed that MAC168425 interferes with glycine metabolism, MAC173979 is a time-dependent inhibitor of p-aminobenzoic acid biosynthesis and MAC13772 inhibits biotin biosynthesis. We conclude that metabolite suppression profiling is an effective approach to focus MOA studies on compounds impairing metabolic capabilities. Such bioactives can serve as chemical probes of bacterial physiology and as leads for antibacterial drug development.',\n",

The in vitro antibacterial activities of these THF carbapenems were evaluated and compared with those of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem against 554 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers across North America. The antibacterial activities of the THF carbapenems were equivalent to that of biapenem, and the THF carbapenems were slightly more active than imipenem and less active than meropenem against most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae but lacked significant activity against Pseudomonas isolates. In general, CL 191,121 was two- to fourfold more active than CL 188,624 and CL 190,294 against the staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates tested. CL 191,121 was twofold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and was as activity as imipenem against Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Biapenem and meropenem were two- and fourfold less active than CL 191,121, respectively, against the methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and E. faecalis. All the carbapenems displayed equivalent good activities against the streptococci. Biapenem was slightly more active than the other carbapenems against Bacteroides fragilis isolates. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated that the THF carbapenems were bactericidal in 6 h against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolates.

We compared the clinical efficacy of ertapenem and other carbapenems in monomicrobial BSI due to ESBL-E. A multinational retrospective cohort study (INCREMENT project) was performed (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01764490). Patients given monotherapy with ertapenem or other carbapenems were compared. Empirical and targeted therapies were analysed. Propensity scores were used to control for confounding; sensitivity analyses were performed in subgroups. The outcome variables were cure/improvement rate at day 14 and all-cause 30 day mortality. The empirical therapy cohort (ETC) and the targeted therapy cohort (TTC) included 195 and 509 patients, respectively. Cure/improvement rates were 90.6% with ertapenem and 75.5% with other carbapenems (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.06) in the ETC and 89.8% and 82.6% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.02) in the TTC, respectively; 30 day mortality rates were 3.1% and 23.3% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.01) in the ETC and 9.3% and 17.1% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.01) in the TTC, respectively.

              " 'DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.',\n",
              " 'Despite a relatively low incidence of serious side effects, fluoroquinolones and the fluoroquinolone pefloxacin have been reported to occasionally promote tendinopathy that might result in the complication of spontaneous rupture of tendons. In the present study, we investigated in rodents the intrinsic deleterious effect of pefloxacin (400 mg/kg of body weight) on Achilles tendon proteoglycans and collagen. Proteoglycan synthesis was determined by measurement of in vivo and ex vivo radiosulfate incorporation in mice. Collagen oxidative modifications were measured by carbonyl derivative detection by Western blotting. An experimental model of tendinous ischemia (2 h) and reperfusion (3 days) was achieved in rats. Biphasic changes in proteoglycan synthesis were observed after a single administration of pefloxacin, consisting of an early inhibition followed by a repair-like phase. The depletion phase was accompanied by a marked decrease in the endogenous serum sulfate level and a concomitant increase in the level of sulfate excretion in urine. Studies of ex vivo proteoglycan synthesis confirmed the in vivo results that were obtained. The decrease in proteoglycan anabolism seemed to be a direct effect of pefloxacin on tissue metabolism rather than a consequence of the low concentration of sulfate. Pefloxacin treatment for several days induced oxidative damage of type I collagen, with the alterations being identical to those observed in the experimental tendinous ischemia and reperfusion model. Oxidative damage was prevented by coadministration of N-acetylcysteine (150 mg/kg) to the mice. These results provide the first experimental evidence of a pefloxacin-induced oxidative stress in the Achilles tendon that altered proteoglycan anabolism and oxidized collagen.',\n",
              " 'DNA gyrases are enzymes that control the topology of DNA in bacteria cells. This is a vital function for bacteria. For this reason, DNA gyrases are targeted by widely used antibiotics such as quinolones. Recently, structural and biochemical investigations identified a new class of DNA gyrase inhibitors called NBTIs (i.e., novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors). NBTIs are particularly promising because they are active against multi-drug resistant bacteria, an alarming clinical issue. Structural data recently demonstrated that these NBTIs bind tightly to a newly identified pocket at the dimer interface of the DNA-protein complex. In the present study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking calculations to shed new light on the binding of NBTIs to this site. Interestingly, our MD simulations demonstrate the intrinsic flexibility of this binding site, which allows the pocket to adapt its conformation and form optimal interactions with the ligand. In particular, we examined two ligands, AM8085 and AM8191, which induced a repositioning of a key aspartate (Asp83B), whose side chain can rotate within the binding site. The conformational rearrangement of Asp83B allows the formation of a newly identified H-bond interaction with an NH on the bound NBTI, which seems important for the binding of NBTIs having such functionality. We validated these findings through docking calculations using an extended set of cognate oxabicyclooctane-linked NBTIs derivatives (~150, in total), screened against multiple target conformations. The newly identified H-bond interaction significantly improves the docking enrichment. These insights could be helpful for future virtual screening campaigns against DNA gyrase.',\n",

Here we report its PK profile after the administration of multiple oral doses of a suspension to healthy adults. Bioequivalence between suspension and capsule formulations, as well as the effect of food, is also reported. The most important PK features of EDP-420 observed in these clinical studies are its long half-life of 17 to 18 h and its high systemic exposure, which support once-daily dosing and treatment durations potentially shorter than those of most other macrolide antibiotics. EDP-420 is readily absorbed following oral administration in both suspension and capsule formulations. In the multiple-oral-dose study, steady state was achieved on day 1 by using a loading dose of 400 mg/day, followed by 2 days of 200 mg/day. A high-fat meal had no effect on the bioavailability of EDP-420 administered in a capsule formulation. EDP-420 was well tolerated, with no serious or severe adverse events reported, and no subject was discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. Based on its human PK and safety profiles, together with its in vitro/in vivo activities against common respiratory pathogens, EDP-420 warrants further development, including trials for clinical efficacy in the treatment of RTI.',\n",

EPM displayed excellent activity against staphylococci, enterococci, pneumococci, and streptococci which was considerably better than that of trimethoprim (TMP). EPM was also active against TMP-resistant strains, although the MICs were still relatively high. Its combination with dapsone (DDS) was synergistic and showed as in vitro activity superior to that of the TMP combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMZ). The EPM-DDS (ratio, 1:19) combination inhibited more than 90% of all important gram-positive pathogens at a concentration of 2 + 38 micrograms/ml. Only a few highly TMP-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were not inhibited. EPM was also more active than TMP against Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, and Bacteroides spp., but it was less active than TMP against all other gram-negative bacteria tested. Atypical mycobacteria were poorly susceptible to EPM, but the combination with DDS was synergistic and active at concentrations most probably achievable in biological fluids (MICs from 0.25 +/- 4.75 to 4 + 76 micrograms/ml). EPM and the EPM-DDS combination were also highly active against experimental staphylococcal infections in a mouse septicemia model.

Kinetic studies on binding of carbenicillin to penicillin-binding proteins both in isolated membrane preparations and in intact cells revealed that carbenicillin penetration into resistant cells was a much slower process than in susceptible cells, suggesting that the outer envelope structures serve as an efficient barrier against carbenicillin entry into our P. aeruginosa strains from clinical isolates.',\n",

Most agents under development are modifications of existing drug classes, which only partially overcome existing resistance mechanisms. Therefore, new classes of Gram-negative antibacterials with truly novel modes of action are needed to circumvent these existing resistance mechanisms. We have previously identified a new a way to inhibit an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), in fungi via the oxaborole tRNA trapping (OBORT) mechanism. Herein, we show how we have modified the OBORT mechanism using a structure-guided approach to develop a new boron-based antibiotic class, the aminomethylbenzoxaboroles, which inhibit bacterial leucyl-tRNA synthetase and have activity against Gram-negative bacteria by largely evading the main efflux mechanisms in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The lead analogue, AN3365, is active against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae bearing NDM-1 and KPC carbapenemases, as well as P. aeruginosa. This novel boron-based antibacterial, AN3365, has good mouse pharmacokinetics and was efficacious against E. coli and P. aeruginosa in murine thigh infection models, which suggest that this novel class of antibacterials has the potential to address this unmet medical need.',\n",
              " \"Halogenation of a suitably protected netilmicin derivative enables preparation of 4'-chloro-, bromo-, and iodo derivatives of netilmicin after deprotection. Suzuki coupling of a protected 4'-bromo derivative with phenylboronic acid or butyltrifluoroborate affords the corresponding 4'-phenyl and 4'-butyl derivatives of netilmicin. Sulfenylation of suitably protected netilmicin derivative with ethanesulfenyl chloride followed by deprotection affords 4'-ethylsulfanylnetilmicin. All netilmicin 4'-derivatives displayed reduced levels of inhibition for prokaryotic ribosomes and reduced antibacterial activity against typical Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. None of the derivatives displayed enhanced target selectivity.\",\n",
              " 'Hyponatraemia (HN) is the most common electrolyte balance disorder in clinical practice. Since the 1970s, demeclocycline has been used in some countries to treat chronic HN secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The precise mechanism of action of demeclocycline is unclear, but has been linked to the induction of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Furthermore, the safety profile of demeclocycline is variable with an inconsistent time to onset, and a potential for complications. There has been no systematic evaluation of the use of demeclocycline for the treatment of HN secondary to SIADH to date. A systematic literature review was performed to obtain an insight into the clinical safety and efficacy of demeclocycline for this condition. Embase(™) , MEDLINE(®) , MEDLINE(®) In-Process, and The Cochrane Library were searched on two occasions using MeSH terms combined with free-text terms. References were screened by two independent reviewers. Relevant publications were then extracted by two independent reviewers, with a third reviewer collating and finalising extractions. The searches returned a total of 705 hits. 632 abstracts were screened after the removal of duplicates. Following screening, 35 full-length publications were reviewed. Of these, 17 were excluded, resulting in 18 studies deemed relevant for data extraction. Two were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 16 were non-RCTs, and 10 were case reports. Although most reports suggest that demeclocycline can address serum sodium levels in specific patients with HN, efficacy is variable, and may depend upon the underlying aetiology. Demeclocycline dose adjustments can be complex, and as its use in clinical practice is not well defined, it can differ between healthcare professionals. There is a lack of clinical and economic evidence supporting the use of demeclocycline for HN secondary to SIADH. Patients receiving demeclocycline for HN secondary to SIADH must be closely monitored.',\n",
              " 'Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) continues to be a significant human health problem. IDILI is characterized as occurring in a minority of individuals exposed to a drug, yet it accounts for as much as 17% of all cases of acute liver failure. Despite these concerns, the mechanisms underlying IDILI remain unknown. Trovafloxacin (TVX), which causes IDILI in humans, also causes hepatocellular death in vitro when combined with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this toxicity are not fully characterized. The purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms by which TVX and TNF interact to cause hepatocellular death, with a focus on a human hepatocyte cell line. TVX and TNF interacted to cause cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells at drug concentrations similar to those in people undergoing TVX therapy. TVX/TNF treatment caused apoptosis and DNA damage in HepG2 cells that depended on caspase activation. Prolonged activation of JNK occurred in TVX/TNF-induced cytotoxicity, and treatment with the JNK selective inhibitor SP600125 attenuated cytotoxicity. TVX/TNF cotreatment also caused cytotoxicity in isolated primary murine hepatocytes that was dependent on caspase activation. These results increase understanding of molecular signaling pathways involved in hepatocellular death caused by a drug with idiosyncratic liability in the presence of TNF.',\n",
              " 'Impeding, as well as reducing, the burden of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative pathogens is an urgent public health endeavor. Our current antibiotic armamentarium is dwindling, while major resistance determinants (e.g., extended-spectrum β-lactamases [ESBLs]) continue to evolve and disseminate around the world. One approach to attack this problem is to develop novel therapies that will protect our current agents. AAI101 is a novel penicillanic acid sulfone β-lactamase inhibitor similar in structure to tazobactam, with one important difference. AAI101 possesses a strategically placed methyl group that gives the inhibitor a net neutral charge, enhancing bacterial cell penetration. AAI101 paired with cefepime, also a zwitterion, is in phase III of clinical development for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections. Here, AAI101 was found to restore the activity of cefepime against class A ESBLs (e.g., CTX-M-15) and demonstrated increased potency compared to that of piperacillin-tazobactam when tested against an established isogenic panel. The enzymological properties of AAI101 further revealed that AAI101 possessed a unique mechanism of β-lactamase inhibition compared to that of tazobactam. Additionally, upon reaction with AAI101, CTX-M-15 was modified to an inactive state. Notably, the in vivo efficacy of cefepime-AAI101 was demonstrated using a mouse septicemia model, indicating the ability of AAI101 to bolster significantly the therapeutic efficacy of cefepime in vivo The combination of AAI101 with cefepime represents a potential carbapenem-sparing treatment regimen for infections suspected to be caused by Enterobacteriaceae expressing ESBLs.',\n",

              " 'Lipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) catalyzes the first step in the biogenesis of Gram-negative bacterial lipoproteins which play crucial roles in bacterial growth and pathogenesis. We demonstrate that Lgt depletion in a clinical uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain leads to permeabilization of the outer membrane and increased sensitivity to serum killing and antibiotics. Importantly, we identify G2824 as the first-described Lgt inhibitor that potently inhibits Lgt biochemical activity in vitro and is bactericidal against wild-type Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli strains. While deletion of a gene encoding a major outer membrane lipoprotein, lpp, leads to rescue of bacterial growth after genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream type II signal peptidase, LspA, no such rescue of growth is detected after Lgt depletion or treatment with G2824. Inhibition of Lgt does not lead to significant accumulation of peptidoglycan-linked Lpp in the inner membrane. Our data validate Lgt as a novel antibacterial target and suggest that, unlike downstream steps in lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport, inhibition of Lgt may not be sensitive to one of the most common resistance mechanisms that invalidate inhibitors of bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport. IMPORTANCE As the emerging threat of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria continues to increase, no new classes of antibiotics have been discovered in the last 50 years. While previous attempts to inhibit the lipoprotein biosynthetic (LspA) or transport (LolCDE) pathways have been made, most efforts have been hindered by the emergence of a common mechanism leading to resistance, namely, the deletion of the gene encoding a major Gram-negative outer membrane lipoprotein lpp. Our unexpected finding that inhibition of Lgt is not susceptible to lpp deletion-mediated resistance uncovers the complexity of bacterial lipoprotein biogenesis and the corresponding enzymes involved in this essential outer membrane biogenesis pathway and potentially points to new antibacterial targets in this pathway.',\n",
              " 'Many approaches are used to discover new antibiotic compounds, one of the most widespread being the chemical modification of known antibiotics. This type of discovery has been so important in the development of new antibiotics that most antibiotics used today belong to the same chemical classes as antibiotics discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. Even though the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, the chemical modification of antibiotics in known classes is still widely used to discover new antibiotics, resulting in a great number of compounds in the discovery and clinical pipeline that belong to existing classes. In this scenario, the present article presents an overview of the R&amp;D pipeline of new antibiotics in known classes of antibiotics, from discovery to clinical trial, in order to map out the technological trends in this type of antibiotic R&amp;D, aiming to identify the chemical classes attracting most interest, their spectrum of activity, and the new subclasses under development. The result of the study shows that the new antibiotics in the pipeline belong to the following chemical classes: quinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides, oxazolidinones, tetracyclines, pleuromutilins, beta-lactams, lipoglycopeptides, polymyxins and cyclic lipopeptides.',\n",
              " 'Multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are an increasing public health threat due to rapidly rising resistance toward β-lactam antibiotics. The hydrolytic enzymes called β-lactamases are responsible for a large proportion of the resistance phenotype. β-Lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) can be administered in combination with β-lactam antibiotics to negate the action of the β-lactamases, thereby restoring activity of the β-lactam. Newly developed BLIs offer some advantage over older BLIs in terms of enzymatic spectrum but are limited to the intravenous route of administration. Reported here is a novel, orally bioavailable diazabicyclooctane (DBO) β-lactamase inhibitor. This new DBO, ETX1317, contains an endocyclic carbon-carbon double bond and a fluoroacetate activating group and exhibits broad spectrum activity against class A, C, and D serine β-lactamases. The ester prodrug of ETX1317, ETX0282, is orally bioavailable and, in combination with cefpodoxime proxetil, is currently in development as an oral therapy for multidrug resistant and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections.',\n",
              " \"Muraminomicin is a lipopeptidyl nucleoside antibiotic produced by Streptosporangium amethystogenes SANK 60709. Similar to several members of this antibiotic family such as A-90289 and muraymycin, the structure of muraminomicin consists of a disaccharide comprised of two modified ribofuranose units linked by an O-β(1 → 5) glycosidic bond; however, muraminomicin holds the distinction in that both ribose units are 2-deoxy sugars. The biosynthetic gene cluster of muraminomicin has been identified, cloned and sequenced, and bioinformatic analysis revealed a minimum of 24 open reading frames putatively involved in the biosynthesis, resistance, and regulation of muraminomicin. Fives enzymes are likely involved in the assembly and attachment of the 2,5-dideoxy-5-aminoribose saccharide unit, and two are now functionally assigned and characterized: Mra20, a 5'-amino-2',5'-dideoxyuridine phosphorylase and Mra23, a UTP:5-amino-2,5-dideoxy-α-D-ribose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. The cumulative results are consistent with the incorporation of the ribosyl appendage of muraminomicin via the archetypical sugar biosynthetic pathway that parallels A-90289 biosynthesis, and the specificity for this appendage is dictated primarily by the two characterized enzymes.\",\n",

              " \"MX-2401 is a semisynthetic calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotic (analogue of amphomycin) in preclinical development for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. In vitro and in vivo, MX-2401 demonstrates broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms, including antibiotic-resistant strains. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of MX-2401 and compare it with that of the lipopeptide daptomycin. The results indicated that although both daptomycin and MX-2401 are in the structural class of Ca²⁺-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics, the latter has a different mechanism of action. Specifically, MX-2401 inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis by binding to the substrate undecaprenylphosphate (C₅₅-P), the universal carbohydrate carrier involved in several biosynthetic pathways. This interaction resulted in inhibition, in a dose-dependent manner, of the biosynthesis of the cell wall precursors lipids I and II and the wall teichoic acid precursor lipid III, while daptomycin had no significant effect on these processes. MX-2401 induced very slow membrane depolarization that was observed only at high concentrations. Unlike daptomycin, membrane depolarization by MX-2401 did not correlate with its bactericidal activity and did not affect general membrane permeability. In contrast to daptomycin, MX-2401 had no effect on lipid flip-flop, calcein release, or membrane fusion with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (POPG) liposomes. MX-2401 adopts a more defined structure than daptomycin, presumably to facilitate interaction with C₅₅-P. Mutants resistant to MX-2401 demonstrated low cross-resistance to other antibiotics. Overall, these results provided strong evidence that the mode of action of MX-2401 is unique and different from that of any of the approved antibiotics, including daptomycin.\",\n",
              " 'Neonatal sepsis is a serious and frequently lethal infection, often complicated by antimicrobial resistance (including ESBLs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Flomoxef is an off-patent oxacephem β-lactam with stability against non-AmpC ESBLs, with potential for utility in these settings. To date, there has been no published flomoxef neonatal population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model. To summarize the clinical data available for flomoxef, build a neonatal PopPK model and assess the adequacy of different neonatal flomoxef regimens. A systematic literature search returned all available clinical or pharmacokinetic data of flomoxef use in neonates. Pharmacokinetic data were used to construct a PopPK model, with progressive incorporation of covariates into the final model. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using this final model to simulate drug exposures of different flomoxef regimens to calculate PTAs. Individual-level clinical and pharmacokinetic data were extracted for 313 and 146 neonates, respectively, with population clinical data extracted for a further 199 neonates. Clinical and microbiological success rates were 89.71% and 82.8%, respectively, with minimal side effects. The final PopPK model incorporated body weight and postnatal age as covariates. PTA analyses predicted that IV regimens of 20 mg/kg q12h, 20 mg/kg q6-8h and 40 mg/kg q6-8h are adequate for neonates aged 0-7, 7-14 and 14-28 days, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published neonatal PopPK model for flomoxef. Given the high treatment success rates, low toxicity rates and off-patent status, this drug has potential for use in the treatment of neonatal sepsis in ESBL-prevalent LMIC settings.',\n",

We investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nifurtimox administered as divisible, dispersible 30 mg and 120 mg tablets in children with Chagas disease. In this blinded, controlled study conducted January 2016-July 2018, 330 patients aged <18 years from 25 medical centres across three South American countries were randomised 2:1 to nifurtimox 10-20 mg/kg/day (aged <12 years) or 8-10 mg/kg/day (aged ≥12 years) for 60 days (n = 219), or for 30 days plus placebo for 30 days (n = 111) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625974). The primary outcome was anti-Trypanosoma cruzi serological response (negative seroconversion or seroreduction ≥20% in mean optical density from baseline determined by two conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) at 12 months in the 60-day treatment group versus historical placebo controls. Nifurtimox for 60 days achieved negative seroconversion (n = 10) and seroreduction (n = 62) in 72 patients (serological response 32.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 26.4%, 39.3%, of all treated patients), confirming superiority relative to the upper 95% CI of 16% for controls. In patients aged <8 months, 10/12 treated for 60 days (83.3%) and 5/7 treated for 30 days (71.4%) achieved negative seroconversion. Overall serological response was lower for 30-day than for 60-day nifurtimox (between-treatment difference 14.0% [95% CI 3.7%, 24.2%]). The frequency of T. cruzi-positive quantitative polymerase chain reactions decreased substantially from baseline levels (60-day regimen 53.4% versus 1.4%; 30-day regimen 51.4% versus 4.5%). Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), which were observed in 62 patients (28.3%) treated for 60 days and 29 patients (26.1%) treated for 30 days, were generally mild or moderate and resolved without sequelae; 4.2% of all TEAEs led to nifurtimox discontinuation. Age- and weight-adjusted nifurtimox for 60 days achieved a serological response at 12 months post-treatment that was superior to historical placebo, was well tolerated and had a favourable safety profile in children with Chagas disease. Although, at 1 year serological follow-up, efficacy of the shorter nifurtimox treatment was not comparable to the 60-day treatment regimen for the overall study population, further long-term follow-up of the patients will provide important information about the progress of serological conversion in children treated with nifurtimox, as well as the potential efficacy difference between the two regimens over time.',\n",
              " 'Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are a class of secondary metabolites usually produced by microorganisms. They are of paramount importance in different applications, including biocontrol and pharmacy. Brevibacillus spp. are a rich source of NRPs yet have received little attention. In this study, we characterize four novel bogorol variants (bogorols I to L, cationic linear lipopeptides) and four succilins (succilins I to L, containing a succinyl group that is attached to the Orn3/Lys3 in bogorols I to L) from the biocontrol strain Brevibacillus laterosporus MG64. Further investigation revealed that the bogorol family of peptides employs an adenylation pathway for lipoinitiation, different from the usual pattern, which is based on an external ligase and coenzyme A. Moreover, the formation of valinol was proven to be mediated by a terminal reductase domain and a reductase encoded by the bogI gene. Furthermore, succinylation, which is a novel type of modification in the family of bogorols, was discovered. Its occurrence requires a high concentration of the substrate (bogorols), but its responsible enzyme remains unknown. Bogorols display potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Investigation of their mode of action reveals that bogorols form pores in the cell membrane of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The combination of bogorols and relacidines, another class of NRPs produced by B. laterosporus MG64, displays a synergistic effect on different pathogens, suggesting the great potential of both peptides as well as their producer B. laterosporus MG64 for broad applications. Our study provides a further understanding of the bogorol family of peptides as well as their applications.IMPORTANCE NRPs form a class of secondary metabolites with biocontrol and pharmaceutical potential. This work describes the identification of novel bogorol variants and succinylated bogorols (namely, succilins) and further investigates their biosynthetic pathway and mode of action. Adenylation domain-mediated lipoinitiation of bogorols represents a novel pathway by which NRPs incorporate fatty acid tails. This pathway provides the possibility to engineer the lipid tail of NRPs without identifying a fatty acid coenzyme ligase, which is usually not present in the biosynthetic gene cluster. The terminal reductase domain (TD) and BogI-mediated valinol formation and their effect on the biological activity of bogorols are revealed. Succinylation, which is rarely reported in NRPs, was discovered in the bogorol family of peptides. We demonstrate that bogorols combat bacterial pathogens by forming pores in the cell membrane. We also report the synergistic effect of two natural products (relacidine B and bogorol K) produced by the same strain, which is relevant for competition for a niche.',\n",
              " \"Novobiocin, coumermycin A1, and clorobiocin, structurally related compounds that antagonize the B subunit of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, were compared with 18 of their analogs for the inhibition of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase supertwisting activity in vitro and of bacterial multiplication. This family of compounds has a 4-hydroxy-8-methylcoumarin core substituted in the 7 and 3 positions. Important for enzyme inhibition in vitro is a 7 ether linkage to a 3'-substituted noviose sugar. The 3'-ester-linked 5-methylpyrrole, found in the coumermycin series, conferred at least 10-fold more inhibitory activity than did the similarly linked amide, found in the novobiocin series; lack of the pyrrole and amide results in the loss of inhibitory activity. Of many aryl and alkyl substituents linked as an amide at the 3 position, the 4-hydroxyl-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)benzoic acid moiety, found in novobiocin and clorobiocin, and the reduplication of the coumarin-noviose-5-methylpyrrole, found in coumermycin A1, were most effective in gyrase inhibition. In vivo, the ability of these compounds to inhibit the growth of E. coli varied greatly. The enhanced inhibition of gyrase in vitro conferred by a 5-methylpyrrole relative to an amide in the 3'-noviose position was reflected in inhibition of bacterial multiplication. Several substitutions at the 3 position of the coumarin core conferring similar antagonism of gyrase in vitro resulted in substantially different inhibitory activities for E. coli, suggesting that these moieties at the 3 position affect drug access to the intracellular target. This target was shown for isobutyryl PNC-NH2 (PNC-NH2 is 3-amino-4-hydroxy-8-methyl-7-[3-O-(5-methyl-2-pyrrolylcarbonyl)noviosyloxy] coumarin) and confirmed for novobiocin, coumermycin A1, and clorobiocin to be in the B subunit of DNA gyrase.\",\n",

              " \"Puromycin is a naturally occurring aminonucleoside antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by ribosome-catalyzed incorporation into the C-terminus of elongating nascent chains, blocking further extension and resulting in premature termination of translation. It is most commonly known as a selection marker for cell lines genetically engineered to express a resistance transgene, but its additional uses as a probe for protein synthesis have proven invaluable across a wide variety of model systems, ranging from purified ribosomes and cell-free translation to intact cultured cells and whole animals. Puromycin is comprised of a nucleoside covalently bound to an amino acid, mimicking the 3' end of aminoacylated tRNAs that participate in delivery of amino acids to elongating ribosomes. Both moieties can tolerate some chemical substitutions and modifications without significant loss of activity, generating a diverse toolbox of puromycin-based reagents with added functionality, such as biotin for affinity purification or fluorophores for fluorescent microscopy detection. These reagents, as well as anti-puromycin antibodies, have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the regulation and dysregulation of protein synthesis in normal and pathological processes, including immune response and neurological function.

We report the first in toto chemical synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of octapeptins, a class of lipopeptides structurally related to colistin. The octapeptin biosynthetic cluster consisted of three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (OctA, OctB, and OctC) that produced an amphiphilic antibiotic, octapeptin C4, which was shown to bind to and depolarize membranes. While active against multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains in\\xa0vitro, octapeptin C4 displayed poor in\\xa0vivo efficacy, most likely due to high plasma protein binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance solution structures, empirical structure-activity and structure-toxicity models were used to design synthetic octapeptins active against MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. The scaffold was then subtly altered to reduce plasma protein binding, while maintaining activity against MDR and XDR bacteria. In\\xa0vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine bacteremia model with a colistin-resistant P.\\xa0aeruginosa clinical isolate.',\n",
              " 'Retapamulin activity against 53 isolates obtained from a mupirocin-resistant community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pediatric disease cluster was evaluated using broth microdilution. All strains were susceptible to retapamulin with minimum inhibitory concentrations ≤ 0.5 μg/mL. DNA sequence analysis of rplC and cfr identified one rplC strain variant that did not demonstrate reduced phenotypic susceptibility to retapamulin. These results demonstrate that retapamulin may be a useful alternative therapy for mupirocin-resistant community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus, especially in disease clusters.',\n",
              " 'Rhodococcus equi, the causal agent of rhodococcosis, is a severe pathogen of foals but also of immunodeficient humans, causing bronchopneumonia. The pathogen is often found together with Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus zooepidemicus in foals. Of great concern is the fact that some R. equi strains are already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro potential of two equine antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), eCATH1 and DEFA1, as new drugs against R. equi and its associated pathogens. The peptides led to growth inhibition and death of R. equi and S. zooepidemicus at low micromolar concentrations. Moreover, eCATH1 was able to inhibit growth of K. pneumoniae. Both peptides caused rapid disruption of the R. equi membrane, leading to cell lysis. Interestingly, eCATH1 had a synergic effect together with rifampin. Furthermore, eCATH1 was not cytotoxic against mammalian cells at bacteriolytic concentrations and maintained its high killing activity even at physiological salt concentrations. Our data suggest that equine AMPs, especially eCATH1, may be promising candidates for alternative drugs to control R. equi in mono- and coinfections.',\n",
              " 'Salinomycin, traditionally used as an anti-coccidial drug, has recently been shown to possess anti-cancer and anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) effects, as well as activities to overcome multi-drug resistance based on studies using human cancer cell lines, xenograft mice, and in case reports involving cancer patients in pilot clinical trials. Therefore, salinomycin may be considered as a promising novel anti-cancer agent despite its largely unknown mechanism of action. This review summarizes the pharmacologic effects of salinomycin and presents possible mechanisms by which salinomycin exerts its anti-tumorigenic activities. Recent advances and potential complications that might limit the utilization of salinomycin as an anti-cancer and anti-CSC agent are also presented and discussed.',\n",
              " 'Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) across malaria zones of the world. Fixed dose ACT with shorter courses and fewer tablets may be key determinants to ease of administration and compliance. Children aged one year to 13 years presenting with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were recruited in Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. A total of 250 children each were randomly assigned to receive three doses of artesunate/sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (AS + SMP) (12 hourly doses over 24 hours) or three doses of artesunate/amodiaquine (AS + AQ) (daily doses over 48 hours). Efficacy and safety of the two drugs were assessed using a 28-day follow-up and the primary outcome was PCR- corrected parasitological cure rate and clinical response. There were two (0.4%) early treatment failures, one in each treatment arm. The PCR corrected cure rates for day 28 was 97.9% in the AS + AQ arm and 95.6% in the AS + SMP arm (p = 0.15). The re-infection rate was 1.7% in the AS + AQ arm and 5.7% in the AS + SMP arm (p = 0.021). The fever clearance time was similar in the two treatment groups: 1 - 2 days for both AS + SMP and AS + AQ (p = 0.271). The parasite clearance time was also similar in the two treatment groups with 1 - 7 days for AS + SMP and 1 - 4 days for AS + AQ (p = 0.941). The proportion of children with gametocytes over the follow-up period was similar in both treatment groups. Serious Adverse Events were not reported in any of the patients and in all children, laboratory values (packed cell volume, liver enzymes, bilirubin) remained within normal levels during the follow-up period but the packed cell volume was significantly lower in the AS + SMP group. This study demonstrates that AS + SMP FDC given as three doses over 24 hours (12-hour intervals) has similar efficacy as AS + AQ FDC given as three doses over 48 hours (24-hour interval) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Nigeria. Both drugs also proved to be safe. Therefore, AS + SMP could be an alternative to currently recommended first-line ACT with continuous resistance surveillance.',\n",
              " 'Skin is a hierarchical and multi-cellular organ exposed to the external environment with a key protective and regulatory role. Wounds caused by disease and trauma can lead to a loss of function, which can be debilitating and even cause death. Accelerating the natural skin healing process and minimizing the risk of infection is a clinical challenge. Electrospinning is a key technology in the development of wound dressings and skin substitutes as it enables extracellular matrix-mimicking fibrous structures and delivery of bioactive materials. Honey is a promising biomaterial for use in skin tissue engineering applications and has antimicrobial properties and potential tissue regenerative properties. This preliminary study investigates a solution electrospun composite nanofibrous mesh based on polycaprolactone and a medical grade honey, SurgihoneyRO. The processing conditions were optimized and assessed by scanning electron microscopy to fabricate meshes with uniform fiber diameters and minimal presence of beads. The chemistry of the composite meshes was examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photon spectroscopy showing incorporation of honey into the polymer matrix. Meshes incorporating honey had lower mechanical properties due to lower polymer content but were more hydrophilic, resulting in an increase in swelling and an accelerated degradation profile. The biocompatibility of the meshes was assessed using human dermal fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells, which showed comparable or higher cell metabolic activity and viability for SurgihoneyRO-containing meshes compared to polycaprolactone only meshes. The meshes showed no antibacterial properties in a disk diffusion test due to a lack of hydrogen peroxide production and release. The developed polycaprolactone-honey nanofibrous meshes have potential for use in skin applications.',\n",
              " \"Sodium pseudomonate was shown to be a powerful competitive inhibitor of Escherichia coli B isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (Ile-tRNA synthetase). The antibiotic competitively inhibits (Ki 6 nM; cf. Km 6.3 microM), with respect top isoleucine, the formation of the enzyme . Ile approximately AMP complex as measured by the pyrophosphate-exchange reaction, and has no effect on the transfer of [14C]isoleucine from the enzyme . [14C]Ile approximately AMP complex to tRNAIle. The inhibitory constant for the pyrophosphate-exchange reaction was of the same order as that determined for the inhibition of the overall aminoacylation reaction (Ki 2.5 nM; cf. Km 11.1 microM). Sodium [9'-3H]pseudomonate forms a stable complex with Ile-tRNA synthetase. Gel-filtration and gel-electrophoresis studies showed that the antibiotic is only fully released from the complex by 5 M-urea treatment or boiling in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate. The molar binding ratio of sodium [9'-3H]pseudomonate to Ile-tRNA synthetase was found to be 0.85:1 by equilibrium dialysis. Aminoacylation of yeast tRNAIle by rat liver Ile-tRNA synthetase was also competitively inhibited with respect to isoleucine, Ki 20 microM (cf. Km 5.4 microM). The Km values for the rat liver and E. coli B enzymes were of the same order, but the Ki for the rat liver enzyme was 8000 times the Ki for the E. coli B enzyme. This presumably explains the low toxicity of the antibiotic in mammals.\",\n",

Streptolydigin can inhibit polymerization after the reaction has started, whereas rifamycin is effective only if it is preincubated with RNA polymerase prior to the addition of substrates.

The clinical use of sulbactam for A. baumannii infections is of interest due to increasing multidrug resistance in this pathogen. However, the molecular drivers of its antibacterial activity and resistance determinants have yet to be precisely defined. Here we show that the antibacterial activities of sulbactam vary widely across contemporary A. baumannii clinical isolates and are mediated through inhibition of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) PBP1 and PBP3, with very low frequency of resistance; the rare pbp3 mutants with high levels of resistance to sulbactam are attenuated in fitness. These results support further investigation of the potential clinical utility of sulbactam.',\n",

To uncover therapeutically effective antimicrobial agents from a chemical library, we screened over 100,000 synthetic compounds for in vitro antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and evaluated the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of the hits in S. aureus-infected silkworms. Three antimicrobial agents exhibited therapeutic effects in the silkworm infection model. One of these, GPI0363, a novel spiro-heterocyclic compound, was bacteriostatic and inhibited RNA synthesis in S. aureus cells. GPI0363-resistant S. aureus strains harbored a point mutation in the gene encoding the primary sigma factor, SigA, of RNA polymerase, and this mutation was responsible for the resistance to GPI0363. We further revealed that GPI0363 could bind to SigA, inhibit promoter-specific transcription in vitro, and prolong the survival of mice infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Thus, GPI0363 is an attractive candidate therapeutic agent against drug-resistant S. aureus infections.',\n",

Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.',\n",
              " 'The antibacterial activities and target inhibition of 15 quinolones against grlA and gyrA mutant strains were studied. The strains were obtained from wild-type Staphylococcus aureus MS5935 by selection with norfloxacin and nadifloxacin, respectively. The antibacterial activities of most quinolones against both mutant strains were lower than those against the wild-type strain. The ratios of MICs for the gyrA mutant strain to those for the grlA mutant strain (MIC ratio) varied from 0.125 to 4. The ratios of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of quinolones against topoisomerase IV to those against DNA gyrase (IC(50) ratios) also varied, from 0.177 to 5.52. A significant correlation between the MIC ratios and the IC(50) ratios was observed (r = 0.919; P < 0.001). These results suggest that the antibacterial activities of quinolones against the wild-type strain are involved not only in topoisomerase IV inhibition but also in DNA gyrase inhibition and that the target preference in the wild-type strain can be anticipated by the MIC ratios. Based on the MIC ratios, the quinolones were classified into three categories. Type I quinolones (norfloxacin, enoxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin) had MIC ratios of <1, type II quinolones (sparfloxacin and nadifloxacin) had MIC ratios of >1, and type III quinolones (gatifloxacin, pazufloxacin, moxifloxacin, and clinafloxacin) had MIC ratios of 1. Type I and type II quinolones seem to prefer topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase, respectively. Type III quinolones seem to target both enzymes at nearly the same level in bacterial cells (a phenomenon known as the dual-targeting property), and their IC(50) ratios were approximately 2.',\n",
              " \"The antibiotic spectinomycin is a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis with a unique mechanism of action and an excellent safety index, but it lacks antibacterial activity against most clinically important pathogens. A series of N-benzyl-substituted 3'-(R)-3'-aminomethyl-3'-hydroxy spectinomycins was developed on the basis of a computational analysis of the aminomethyl spectinomycin binding site and structure-guided synthesis. These compounds had ribosomal inhibition values comparable to spectinomycin but showed increased potency against the common respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as the sexually transmitted bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Non-ribosome-binding 3'-(S) isomers of the lead compounds demonstrated weak inhibitory activity in in vitro protein translation assays and poor antibacterial activity, indicating that the antibacterial activity of the series remains on target against the ribosome. Compounds also demonstrated no mammalian cytotoxicity, improved microsomal stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in rats. The lead compound from the series exhibited excellent chemical stability superior to spectinomycin; no interaction with a panel of human receptors and drug metabolism enzymes, suggesting low potential for adverse reactions or drug-drug interactions in vivo; activity in vitro against a panel of penicillin-, macrolide-, and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae clinical isolates; and the ability to cure mice of fatal pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Together, these studies indicate that N-benzyl aminomethyl spectinomycins are suitable for further development to treat drug-resistant respiratory tract and sexually transmitted bacterial infections.\",\n",

New classes of antimicrobial compounds are urgently needed as the frequency of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microbes continues to rise. Recent metagenomic data have demonstrated that there is still biosynthetic potential encoded in but transcriptionally silent in cultivatable bacterial genomes. However, the culture conditions required to identify and express silent biosynthetic gene clusters that yield natural products with antimicrobial activity are largely unknown. Here, we describe a new antibiotic discovery scheme, dubbed the modified crowded plate technique (mCPT), that utilizes complex microbial interactions to elicit antimicrobial production from otherwise silent biosynthetic gene clusters. Using the mCPT as part of the antibiotic crowdsourcing educational program Tiny EarthTM, we isolated over 1400 antibiotic-producing microbes, including 62 showing activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens. The natural product extracts generated from six microbial isolates showed potent activity against vancomycin-intermediate resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We utilized a targeted approach that coupled mass spectrometry data with bioactivity, yielding a new macrolactone class of metabolite, desertomycin H. In this study, we successfully demonstrate a concept that significantly increased our ability to quickly and efficiently identify microbes capable of the silent antibiotic production.',\n",
              " 'The clinical development of FtsZ-targeting benzamide compounds like PC190723 has been limited by poor drug-like and pharmacokinetic properties. Development of prodrugs of PC190723 (e.g., TXY541) resulted in enhanced pharmaceutical properties, which, in turn, led to improved intravenous efficacy as well as the first demonstration of oral efficacy in vivo against both methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Despite being efficacious in vivo, TXY541 still suffered from suboptimal pharmacokinetics and the requirement of high efficacious doses. We describe here the design of a new prodrug (TXA709) in which the Cl group on the pyridyl ring has been replaced with a CF3 functionality that is resistant to metabolic attack. As a result of this enhanced metabolic stability, the product of the TXA709 prodrug (TXA707) is associated with improved pharmacokinetic properties (a 6.5-fold-longer half-life and a 3-fold-greater oral bioavailability) and superior in vivo antistaphylococcal efficacy relative to PC190723. We validate FtsZ as the antibacterial target of TXA707 and demonstrate that the compound retains potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus strains resistant to the current standard-of-care drugs vancomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid. These collective properties, coupled with minimal observed toxicity to mammalian cells, establish the prodrug TXA709 as an antistaphylococcal agent worthy of clinical development.',\n",

Here, a comprehensive screening was implemented to identify potential agents that disrupt the assembly of β-barrel outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) in the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. The assembly of OMPs requires ubiquitous β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM). Among the five protein subunits in BAM, the interaction between BamA and BamD is essential for the function of this complex. We first established a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to confirm the interaction between BamA and BamD, and then screened agents that specifically disrupt this interaction. From this screen, we identified a compound IMB-H4 that specially blocks BamA-BamD interaction and selectively inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, our results suggest that IMB-H4 disrupts BamA-BamD interaction by binding to BamA. Strikingly, E. coli cells having been treated with IMB-H4 showed impaired OM integrity and decreased the abundance of OMPs. Therefore, an antibacterial agent was identified successfully using Y2H system, and this compound likely blocks the assembly of OMPs by targeting BamA-BamD interaction in Gram-negative bacteria.',\n",

Although many representatives were withdrawn due to severe adverse reactions, a few representatives have proven their therapeutical value over time. The classification of antibacterial quinolones into generations is a valuable tool for physicians, pharmacists, and researchers. In addition, the transition from one generation to another has brought new representatives with improved properties. In the last two decades, several representatives of antibacterial quinolones received approval for therapy. This review sets out to chronologically outline the group of approved antibacterial quinolones since 2000. Special attention is given to eight representatives: besifloxacin, delafoxacin, finafloxacin, lascufloxacin, nadifloxacin and levonadifloxacin, nemonoxacin, and zabofloxacin. These compounds have been characterized regarding physicochemical properties, formulations, antibacterial activity spectrum and advantageous structural characteristics related to antibacterial efficiency. At present these new compounds (with the exception of nadifloxacin) are reported differently, most often in the fourth generation and less frequently in a new generation (the fifth). Although these new compounds' mechanism does not contain essential new elements, the question of shaping a new generation (the fifth) arises, based on higher potency and broad spectrum of activity, including resistant bacterial strains. The functional groups that ensured the biological activity, good pharmacokinetic properties and a safety profile were highlighted. In addition, these new representatives have a low risk of determining bacterial resistance. Several positive aspects are added to the fourth fluoroquinolones generation, characteristics that can be the basis of the fifth generation.

The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Clostridium spp. tested were 0.39 to 6.25 micrograms/ml. Its activity was comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and four- to eightfold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, but its activity was two- to eightfold less than that of tosufloxacin.

              " 'The need for novel antibiotics has become imperative with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria in clinics. Acting as a permeability barrier, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) protects Gram-negative bacteria against drugs. LPS is synthesized in cells and transported to the outer membrane (OM) via seven lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins (LptA-LptG). Of these seven Lpt proteins, LptC interacts with LptA to transfer LPS from the inner membrane (IM) to the OM, and assembly is aided by LptD/LptE. This interaction among the Lpt proteins is important for the biosynthesis of LPS; therefore, the Lpt proteins, which are significant in the assembly process of LPS, can be a potential target for new antibiotics. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was used to screen compounds that could block LPS transport by inhibiting LptA/LptC interaction, which finally disrupts the biosynthesis of the OM. We selected the compound IMB-0042 for this study. Our results suggest that IMB-0042 disrupts LptA/LptC interaction by binding to both LptA and LptC. Escherichia coli cells, when treated with IMB-0042, showed filament morphology, impaired OM integrity, and an accumulation of LPS in the periplasm. IMB-0042 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria and showed synergistic sensitization to other antibiotics, with low cytotoxicity.

              " 'The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness and safety of cefazolin vs. antistaphylococcal penicillin (ASP) in the treatment of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteraemia. The databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central were used to identify comparative trials of cefazolin vs. ASP in MSSA bacteraemia. Meta-analysis of included trials was performed to assess any differences regarding mortality, clinical cure, recurrence and withdrawal from adverse effects between groups. Data were analysed using fixed effect model. Studies were weighted using Mantel-Haenszel methodology. Heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. Nine retrospective and one prospective trials were identified involving 4728 patients, 2954 with ASP and 1774 with cefazolin. Meta-analysis showed a lower mortality rate with cefazolin vs. ASP using fixed effect model [risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.88, P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001] with borderline high heterogeneity (I2 \\xa0=\\xa051%). Clinical cure was noted more often with cefazolin (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02), although no difference was noted with relapse (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96-1.74 P\\xa0=\\xa00.09). Analysis also showed more withdrawals from adverse events with ASP vs. cefazolin (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.47, P\\xa0<\\xa00.00001). A minority of patients enrolled in these trials were admitted to the intensive care unit or had endocarditis (11.4% with ASP and 9% with cefazolin). Our meta-analysis of retrospective data demonstrate that cefazolin is more effective and safer ASP in patients with MSSA bacteraemia from various causes. Low quality of trials, borderline high heterogeneity, and possible publication bias may limit the validity of our findings. Randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.',\n",
              " 'The outer membrane is an essential structural component of Gram-negative bacteria that is composed of lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, phospholipids, and integral β-barrel membrane proteins. A dedicated machinery, called the Lol system, ensures proper trafficking of lipoproteins from the inner to the outer membrane. The LolCDE ABC transporter is the inner membrane component, which is essential for bacterial viability. Here, we report a novel pyrrolopyrimidinedione compound, G0507, which was identified in a phenotypic screen for inhibitors of Escherichia coli growth followed by selection of compounds that induced the extracytoplasmic σE stress response. Mutations in lolC, lolD, and lolE conferred resistance to G0507, suggesting LolCDE as its molecular target. Treatment of E. coli cells with G0507 resulted in accumulation of fully processed Lpp, an outer membrane lipoprotein, in the inner membrane. Using purified protein complexes, we found that G0507 binds to LolCDE and stimulates its ATPase activity. G0507 still binds to LolCDE harboring a Q258K substitution in LolC (LolCQ258K), which confers high-level resistance to G0507 in vivo but no longer stimulates ATPase activity. Our work demonstrates that G0507 has significant promise as a chemical probe to dissect lipoprotein trafficking in Gram-negative bacteria.',\n",
              " 'The pharmacokinetics of meropenem (ICI 194,660) and its open-ring metabolite (ICI 213,689) were studied in 6 healthy volunteers and 16 patients with moderate to severe renal impairment after a single intravenous dose of 500 mg given as a 30-min infusion. Concentrations of unchanged meropenem in plasma and urine were measured by both microbiological and high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assays. A good correlation was found between the two techniques. Pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged meropenem were determined by using the HPLC data. The terminal half-life of unchanged meropenem increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment, being 1.2 h in subjects with normal renal function and 10 h in patients with end-stage renal failure. Total body clearance and renal clearance of unchanged meropenem are linearly related to creatinine clearance. The concentrations of the metabolite in plasma, which are very low in healthy subjects, significantly increased in uremic patients. The apparent half-life of ICI 213,689 increased in uremic patients and was about 35 h in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Meropenem and its metabolite are effectively removed by hemodialysis. The dialysis clearance of the unchanged drug was 81 +/- 22 ml/min. Dosage adjustments of meropenem will be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment.',\n",

It is free from acute and chronic toxic effects, except that some pain may be caused following intramuscular injection. It is poorly absorbed orally, but after intramuscular injection the concentrations in the serum and in tissues are very similar to those found with penicillin G. It is excreted by the kidneys both by renal tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. It is also excreted in the bile in very high concentrations, the ratio of concentration in the bile to the blood being approximately 2.5 times that of penicillin G.

Three new tetracycline-class antibiotics, eravacycline, omadacycline, and tigecycline, have been approved within the past 15\\u2009years, and represent a new era in the use of tetracyclines. These drugs overcome the two main mechanisms of acquired tetracycline-class resistance and exhibit a broad spectrum of in\\xa0vitro activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical pathogens, including many drug-resistant strains. We provide an overview of the three generations of tetracycline-class drugs, focussing on the efficacy, safety, and clinical utility of these three new third-generation tetracycline-class drugs. We also consider various scenarios of unmet clinical needs where patients might benefit from re-engagement with tetracycline-class antibiotics including outpatient treatment options, patients with known β-lactam antibiotic allergy, reducing the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, and their potential as monotherapy in polymicrobial infections while minimising the risk of any potential drug-drug interaction. KEY MESSAGESThe long-standing safety profile and broad spectrum of activity of tetracycline-class antibiotics made them a popular choice for treatment of various bacterial infections; unfortunately, antimicrobial resistance has limited the utility of the early-generation tetracycline agents.The latest generation of tetracycline-class antibiotics, including eravacycline, tigecycline, and omadacycline, overcomes the most common acquired tetracycline resistance mechanisms.Based on in\\xa0vitro characteristics and clinical data, these newer tetracycline agents provide an effective antibiotic option in the treatment of approved indications in patients with unmet clinical needs - including patients with severe penicillin allergy, with renal or hepatic insufficiency, recent Clostridioides difficile infection, or polymicrobial infections, and those at risk of drug-drug interactions.',\n",

              " 'The relatively rapid development of microbial resistance after the entry of every new antimicrobial into the marketplace necessitates a constant supply of new agents to maintain effective pharmacotherapy. Despite extensive efforts to identify novel lead compounds from molecular targets, only the peptide deformylase inhibitors (PDIs) have shown any real promise, with some advancing to phase I human trials. Bacterial peptide deformylase, which catalyzes the removal of the N-formyl group from N-terminal methionine following translation, is essential for bacterial protein synthesis, growth, and survival. The majority of PDIs are pseudopeptide hydroxamic acids and two of these (IV BB-83698 and oral NVP LBM-415) entered phase I human trials. However, agents to the present have suffered from major potential liabilities. Their in vitro activity has been limited to gram-positive aerobes and some anaerobes and has been quite modest against the majority of such species (MIC(90) values ranging from 1-8 mg/L). They have exerted bacteriostatic, not bacteriocidal, activity, thus reducing their potential usefulness in the management of serious infections in the immunocompromised. The relative ease with which microorganisms have been able to develop resistance and the multiple available mechanisms of resistance (mutations in fmt, defB, folD genes; AcrAB/TolC efflux pump; overexpression of peptide deformylase) are worrisome. These could portend a short timespan of efficacy after marketing. Despite these current liabilities, further pursuit of more potent and broader spectrum PDIs which are less susceptible to bacterial mechanisms of resistance is still warranted.',\n",
              " 'The resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to all β-lactam classes limits treatment options for serious infections involving this organism. Our goal is to discover new agents that restore the activity of β-lactams against MRSA, an approach that has led to the discovery of two classes of natural product antibiotics, a cyclic depsipeptide (krisynomycin) and a lipoglycopeptide (actinocarbasin), which potentiate the activity of imipenem against MRSA strain COL. We report here that these imipenem synergists are inhibitors of the bacterial type I signal peptidase SpsB, a serine protease that is required for the secretion of proteins that are exported through the Sec and Tat systems. A synthetic derivative of actinocarbasin, M131, synergized with imipenem both in vitro and in vivo with potent efficacy. The in vitro activity of M131 extends to clinical isolates of MRSA but not to a methicillin-sensitive strain. Synergy is restricted to β-lactam antibiotics and is not observed with other antibiotic classes. We propose that the SpsB inhibitors synergize with β-lactams by preventing the signal peptidase-mediated secretion of proteins required for β-lactam resistance. Combinations of SpsB inhibitors and β-lactams may expand the utility of these widely prescribed antibiotics to treat MRSA infections, analogous to β-lactamase inhibitors which restored the utility of this antibiotic class for the treatment of resistant Gram-negative infections.',\n",

MICs (mg/L) of DIS-73285 were determined by agar dilution and by Etest for ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, spectinomycin and tetracycline. DIS-73285 was substantially more potent than any of the currently or previously used therapeutic antimicrobials, with MICs ranging from ≤0.001 to 0.004\\u2009mg/L, and the MIC50, MIC90 and modal MIC all ≤0.001\\u2009mg/L (lowest MIC tested).

              " 'The streptothricin natural product mixture (also known as nourseothricin) was discovered in the early 1940s, generating intense initial interest because of excellent gram-negative activity. Here, we establish the activity spectrum of nourseothricin and its main components, streptothricin F (S-F, 1 lysine) and streptothricin D (S-D, 3 lysines), purified to homogeneity, against highly drug-resistant, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii. For CRE, the MIC50 and MIC90 for S-F and S-D were 2 and 4 μM, and 0.25 and 0.5 μM, respectively. S-F and nourseothricin showed rapid, bactericidal activity. S-F and S-D both showed approximately 40-fold greater selectivity for prokaryotic than eukaryotic ribosomes in in vitro translation assays. In vivo, delayed renal toxicity occurred at >10-fold higher doses of S-F compared with S-D. Substantial treatment effect of S-F in the murine thigh model was observed against the otherwise pandrug-resistant, NDM-1-expressing Klebsiella pneumoniae Nevada strain with minimal or no toxicity. Cryo-EM characterization of S-F bound to the A. baumannii 70S ribosome defines extensive hydrogen bonding of the S-F steptolidine moiety, as a guanine mimetic, to the 16S rRNA C1054 nucleobase (Escherichia coli numbering) in helix 34, and the carbamoylated gulosamine moiety of S-F with A1196, explaining the high-level resistance conferred by corresponding mutations at the residues identified in single rrn operon E. coli. Structural analysis suggests that S-F probes the A-decoding site, which potentially may account for its miscoding activity. Based on unique and promising activity, we suggest that the streptothricin scaffold deserves further preclinical exploration as a potential therapeutic for drug-resistant, gram-negative pathogens.',\n",
              " 'The sulfur-containing antibiotic thiolutin has been shown to be a potent, reversible inhibitor of the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Viability was unaffected over the concentration range of 4 to 100 mug/ml. At concentrations as low as 2 mug/ml, the drug inhibited ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein synthesis in whole cells and spheroplasts. At these low concentrations, protein synthesis continued for a short period of time after RNA synthesis was completely stopped. With higher drug concentrations (greater than 20 mug/ml) protein synthesis was inhibited; concentrations of thiolutin up to 100 mug/ml did not affect translocation or peptide bond formation in cell-free protein-synthesizing systems from yeast. The effect of thiolutin on the activity of partially purified deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent RNA polymerases was examined, and the drug was found to be a potent inhibitor of RNA synthesis in vitro. Inhibition was greatest when the polymerase was preincubated with thiolutin. Several mechanisms are discussed to explain the multiple effects of thiolutin on S. cerevisiae. Since the action of the drug is easily reversed, thiolutin may prove to be of use in studies of various stages of yeast growth.',\n",

              " 'Thiotetronate-containing natural products, including thiolactomycin, thiotetromycin, and thiotetroamide, are potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial compounds that target fatty acid synthesis in bacteria. Natural modifications at the C-5 dialkyl position in this molecular series result in pronounced bioactivity differences. The C-5 acetamide-containing thiotetroamide, which is the more potent antibacterial agent in this family, is biosynthesized from the C-5 ethyl analogue thiotetromycin via a unique two-enzyme process involving the cytochrome P450-amidotransferase enzyme pair TtmP-TtmN. Herein we synthesized a focused library of 17 novel thiotetromycin derivatives differing at the 5-position alkyl substituent to investigate their biological activities and their reactivity towards the hydroxylase TtmP. Although we observed marginal anti-tuberculosis activity, select thiotetromycin analogues showed antibacterial activity against an Escherichia coli ΔtolC strain with IC50 values in a range of 1.9-36 μg mL-1. Additional screening efforts highlighted select thiotetronate analogues as inhibitors of the cancer-associated enzyme nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), with a unique scaffold compared to previously identified NNMT inhibitors. In vitro assays further showed that the TtmP P450 was capable of resolving racemic substrate mixtures and had modest promiscuity to hydroxylate derivatives with variable alkyl chains; however triple oxidation to a carboxylic acid remained specific for the natural thiotetromycin substrate. The tendency of TtmP to accept a range of unnatural substrates for hydroxylation makes it an interesting target for P450 engineering towards broader applications.',\n",

In addition, relevant citations obtained from the references cited in the identified reviews, book chapters and antibiotic guidelines were included. Selected articles examining the indications for or adverse effects from the prophylactic or therapeutic use of clindamycin were selected. A level of evidence was assigned to the indication according to published criteria. Randomized clinical trials (level 1 evidence) support the use of clindamycin in a number of common conditions, including preoperative prophylaxis, intra-abdominal infections, recurrent group A streptococcal pharyngitis, Chlamydia trachomatis cervicitis and anaerobic lung infections. Cohort studies (level 2 evidence) support the use of clindamycin for bone and soft tissue infections. Expert opinion (level 3 evidence) supports the use of clindamycin for invasive group A streptococcal infection and the treatment of diabetic foot infections. Clindamycin's disadvantages are its high cost, the common occurrence of rash and the predisposition of patients taking clindamycin to Clostridium difficile-associated colitis.

The compounds exploit beta-lactamases to release triclosan through hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. Like cephalothin, NB2001 and NB2030 were hydrolyzed by class A beta-lactamases (Escherichia coli TEM-1 and, to a lesser degree, Staphylococcus aureus PC1) and class C beta-lactamases (Enterobacter cloacae P99 and E. coli AmpC) with comparable catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m)). They also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and E. coli, but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. Accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in E. coli consistent with the toxophore rather than the beta-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. In biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (FabI), with 50% inhibitory concentrations being markedly reduced relative to that of free triclosan. The transport of NB2001, NB2030, and triclosan was rapid, with significant accumulation of triclosan in both S. aureus and E. coli. Taken together, the results suggest that NB2001 and NB2030 act primarily as triclosan prodrugs in S. aureus and E. coli.',\n",

As with many antibacterial drugs, resistance to the tuberactinomycins is problematic in treating tuberculosis; this makes the development of new derivatives of these antibiotics to combat this resistance of utmost importance. To take steps towards developing new derivatives of this family of antibiotics, we have focused our efforts on understanding how these antibiotics are biosynthesized by the producing bacteria so that metabolic engineering of these pathways can be used to generate desired derivatives. Here we present the heterologous production of viomycin in Streptomyces lividans 1326 and the use of targeted-gene deletion as a mechanism for investigating viomycin biosynthesis as well as the generation of viomycin derivatives. Deletion of vioQ resulted in nonhydroxylated derivatives of viomycin, while strains lacking vioP failed to acylate the cyclic pentapeptide core of viomycin with beta-lysine. Surprisingly, strains lacking vioL produced derivatives that had the carbamoyl group of viomycin replaced by an acetyl group. Additionally, the acetylated viomycin derivatives were produced at very low levels. These two observations suggested that the carbamoyl group of the cyclic pentapeptide core of viomycin was introduced at an earlier step in the biosynthetic pathway than previously proposed. We present biochemical evidence that the carbamoyl group is added to the beta-amino group of L-2,3-diaminopropionate prior to incorporation of this amino acid by the nonribosomal peptide synthetases that form the cyclic pentapeptide cores of both viomycin and capreomycin.',\n",

A total of 17 compounds showed activity against S. aureus. Four derivatives were evaluated against a panel of 16 Gram-positive strains, inclusive of several methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. These compounds are broadly active against Gram-positive bacteria.',\n",

Purified peptides showed approximately 50% inhibition of the bacterial population when used individually and up to 90% when used in combination. The 50% lethal doses (LD50) of hBD-1 against S. Typhi, E. coli, and S. aureus were 0.36, 0.40, and 0.69 μg/μl, respectively, while those for hBD-2 against the same bacteria were 0.38, 0.36, and 0.66 μg/μl, respectively. Moreover, we observed that bacterium-derived antimicrobial peptides were also effective in increasing survival time and decreasing bacterial loads in the peritoneal fluid, liver, and spleen of a mouse intraperitoneally infected with S. Typhi. The 1:1 hBD-1/hBD-2 combination showed maximum effectiveness in challenging the Salmonella infection in vitro and in vivo. We also observed less tissue damage and sepsis formation in the livers of infected mice after treatment with hBD-1 and hBD-2 peptides individually or in combination.

ETX0914, the first of a new class of antibacterial agent targeted for the treatment of gonorrhea, operates by a novel mode-of-inhibition against bacterial type II topoisomerases. Incorporating an oxazolidinone on the scaffold mitigated toxicological issues often seen with topoisomerase inhibitors. Organisms resistant to other topoisomerase inhibitors were not cross-resistant with ETX0914 nor were spontaneous resistant mutants to ETX0914 cross-resistant with other topoisomerase inhibitor classes, including the widely used fluoroquinolone class. Preclinical evaluation of ETX0914 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed distribution into vascular tissues and efficacy in a murine Staphylococcus aureus infection model that served as a surrogate for predicting efficacious exposures for the treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. A wide safety margin to the efficacious exposure in toxicological evaluations supported progression to Phase 1. Dosing ETX0914 in human volunteers showed sufficient exposure and minimal adverse effects to expect a highly efficacious anti-gonorrhea therapy.']"

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of the Gram-negative organism Acinetobacter baumannii utilize a number of resistance determinants to evade current antibiotics. One of the major resistance mechanisms employed by these pathogens is the use of multidrug efflux pumps. These pumps extrude xenobiotics directly out of bacterial cells, resulting in treatment failures when common antibiotics are administered. Here, the structure of the novel tetracycline antibiotic TP-6076, bound to both the Acinetobacter drug efflux pump AdeJ and the ribosome from Acinetobacter baumannii, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), is elucidated. In this work, the structure of the AdeJ-TP-6076 complex is solved, and we show that AdeJ utilizes a network of hydrophobic interactions to recognize this fluorocycline. Concomitant with this, we elucidate three structures of TP-6076 bound to the A. baumannii ribosome and determine that its binding is stabilized largely by electrostatic interactions. We then compare the differences in binding modes between TP-6076 and the related tetracycline antibiotic eravacycline in both targets. These differences suggest that modifications to the tetracycline core may be able to alter AdeJ binding while maintaining interactions with the ribosome. Together, this work highlights how different mechanisms are used to stabilize the binding of tetracycline-based compounds to unique bacterial targets and provides guidance for the future clinical development of tetracycline antibiotics. IMPORTANCE Treatment of antibiotic-resistant organisms such as A. baumannii represents an ongoing issue for modern medicine. The multidrug efflux pump AdeJ serves as a major resistance determinant in A. baumannii through its action of extruding antibiotics from the cell.

Polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales. Polymyxins were first discovered in the late 1940s but were abandoned soon after their approval in the late 1950s as a result of toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity) and the availability of \"safer\" antibiotics approved at that time. Therefore, knowledge on polymyxins had been scarce until recently, when enormous efforts have been made by several research teams around the world to elucidate the chemical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and toxicological properties of polymyxins. One of the major achievements is the development of the first scientifically based dosage regimens for colistin that are crucial to ensure its safe and effective use in patients. Although the guideline has not been developed for polymyxin B, a large clinical trial is currently being conducted to optimize its clinical use. Importantly, several novel, safer polymyxin-like lipopeptides are developed to overcome the nephrotoxicity, poor efficacy against pulmonary infections, and narrow therapeutic windows of the currently used polymyxin B and colistin.

In this study, we identified and characterized an endolysin, termed PlyPy (phage lysin from S. pyogenes), from a prophage infecting S. pyogenes.

Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteracting this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Both of these molecules eventually inactivate the target enzymes permanently. Although clavulanic acid exhibits more potent inhibitory activity than sulbactam, especially against the TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, the spectrum of inhibitory activities are very similar. Neither of these inhibitors acts as a good inhibitor of the cephalosporinases. Clavulanic acid has been most frequently combined with amoxicillin in the orally active Augmentin and with ticarcillin in the parenteral beta-lactam combination Timentin. Sulbactam has been used primarily to protect ampicillin from enzymatic hydrolysis. Sulbactam has been used either in the orally absorbed prodrug form as sultamicillin or as the injectable combination ampicillin-sulbactam. Synergy has been demonstrated for these combinations for most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, although those organisms that produce cephalosporinases are not well inhibited. Synergy has also been observed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic organisms.

In this present study, we used the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) in T24 bladder cancer cells to show that heliomycin (designated compound (H1)) and its 4-(tert-butylamino)methyl derivative (HD2) directly engaged with SIRT1 in the native cellular environment, whereas another derivative (HD3) did not. Upon binding, heliomycin downregulated SIRT1 protein expression without altering its transcript level, and subsequently induced autophagy. Interestingly, the derivative (HD2) triggered apoptosis. The interaction between SIRT1 protein and heliomycin or its derivatives was also speculated by a molecular docking simulation, suggesting heliomycin (H1) and derivative (HD2) acting with the different binding modes to SIRT1. Given the increased water-solubility, hydrogen bonds were found on Ala262 and Ile347 residues in the docked complex of derivative (HD2) to produce more steady interaction and initiate signaling pathways that were not observed in the case of heliomycin. Meanwhile, it is evident that derivative (HD3) did not engage with SIRT1 by CETSA or molecular docking studies, nor did it downregulate SIRT1 expression. Taken together, these findings clearly show that SIRT1 is targeted and downregulated by heliomycin and its water-soluble 4-aminomethylated derivative (HD2) possibly through autophagic and/or proteasomal degradation, leading to cell death and growth suppression of T24 bladder cancer cells.',\n",

Proteoglycan synthesis was determined by measurement of in vivo and ex vivo radiosulfate incorporation in mice. Collagen oxidative modifications were measured by carbonyl derivative detection by Western blotting. An experimental model of tendinous ischemia (2 h) and reperfusion (3 days) was achieved in rats. Biphasic changes in proteoglycan synthesis were observed after a single administration of pefloxacin, consisting of an early inhibition followed by a repair-like phase. The depletion phase was accompanied by a marked decrease in the endogenous serum sulfate level and a concomitant increase in the level of sulfate excretion in urine. Studies of ex vivo proteoglycan synthesis confirmed the in vivo results that were obtained. The decrease in proteoglycan anabolism seemed to be a direct effect of pefloxacin on tissue metabolism rather than a consequence of the low concentration of sulfate.

For this reason, DNA gyrases are targeted by widely used antibiotics such as quinolones. Recently, structural and biochemical investigations identified a new class of DNA gyrase inhibitors called NBTIs (i.e., novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors). NBTIs are particularly promising because they are active against multi-drug resistant bacteria, an alarming clinical issue. Structural data recently demonstrated that these NBTIs bind tightly to a newly identified pocket at the dimer interface of the DNA-protein complex. In the present study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking calculations to shed new light on the binding of NBTIs to this site. Interestingly, our MD simulations demonstrate the intrinsic flexibility of this binding site, which allows the pocket to adapt its conformation and form optimal interactions with the ligand. In particular, we examined two ligands, AM8085 and AM8191, which induced a repositioning of a key aspartate (Asp83B), whose side chain can rotate within the binding site. The conformational rearrangement of Asp83B allows the formation of a newly identified H-bond interaction with an NH on the bound NBTI, which seems important for the binding of NBTIs having such functionality. We validated these findings through docking calculations using an extended set of cognate oxabicyclooctane-linked NBTIs derivatives (~150, in total), screened against multiple target conformations. The newly identified H-bond interaction significantly improves the docking enrichment. These insights could be helpful for future virtual screening campaigns against DNA gyrase.',\n",

We demonstrate that Lgt depletion in a clinical uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain leads to permeabilization of the outer membrane and increased sensitivity to serum killing and antibiotics. Importantly, we identify G2824 as the first-described Lgt inhibitor that potently inhibits Lgt biochemical activity in vitro and is bactericidal against wild-type Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli strains. While deletion of a gene encoding a major outer membrane lipoprotein, lpp, leads to rescue of bacterial growth after genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream type II signal peptidase, LspA, no such rescue of growth is detected after Lgt depletion or treatment with G2824. Inhibition of Lgt does not lead to significant accumulation of peptidoglycan-linked Lpp in the inner membrane. Our data validate Lgt as a novel antibacterial target and suggest that, unlike downstream steps in lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport, inhibition of Lgt may not be sensitive to one of the most common resistance mechanisms that invalidate inhibitors of bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport. IMPORTANCE As the emerging threat of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria continues to increase, no new classes of antibiotics have been discovered in the last 50 years.

The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of MX-2401 and compare it with that of the lipopeptide daptomycin. The results indicated that although both daptomycin and MX-2401 are in the structural class of Ca²⁺-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics, the latter has a different mechanism of action. Specifically, MX-2401 inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis by binding to the substrate undecaprenylphosphate (C₅₅-P), the universal carbohydrate carrier involved in several biosynthetic pathways. This interaction resulted in inhibition, in a dose-dependent manner, of the biosynthesis of the cell wall precursors lipids I and II and the wall teichoic acid precursor lipid III, while daptomycin had no significant effect on these processes. MX-2401 induced very slow membrane depolarization that was observed only at high concentrations.

Children aged one year to 13 years presenting with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were recruited in Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. A total of 250 children each were randomly assigned to receive three doses of artesunate/sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (AS + SMP) (12 hourly doses over 24 hours) or three doses of artesunate/amodiaquine (AS + AQ) (daily doses over 48 hours). Efficacy and safety of the two drugs were assessed using a 28-day follow-up and the primary outcome was PCR- corrected parasitological cure rate and clinical response. There were two (0.4%) early treatment failures, one in each treatment arm. The PCR corrected cure rates for day 28 was 97.9% in the AS + AQ arm and 95.6% in the AS + SMP arm (p = 0.15). The re-infection rate was 1.7% in the AS + AQ arm and 5.7% in the AS + SMP arm (p = 0.021).

Serious Adverse Events were not reported in any of the patients and in all children, laboratory values (packed cell volume, liver enzymes, bilirubin) remained within normal levels during the follow-up period but the packed cell volume was significantly lower in the AS + SMP group. This study demonstrates that AS + SMP FDC given as three doses over 24 hours (12-hour intervals) has similar efficacy as AS + AQ FDC given as three doses over 48 hours (24-hour interval) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Nigeria.

Meshes incorporating honey had lower mechanical properties due to lower polymer content but were more hydrophilic, resulting in an increase in swelling and an accelerated degradation profile. The biocompatibility of the meshes was assessed using human dermal fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells, which showed comparable or higher cell metabolic activity and viability for SurgihoneyRO-containing meshes compared to polycaprolactone only meshes.

Data were analysed using fixed effect model. Studies were weighted using Mantel-Haenszel methodology. Heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. Nine retrospective and one prospective trials were identified involving 4728 patients, 2954 with ASP and 1774 with cefazolin. Meta-analysis showed a lower mortality rate with cefazolin vs. ASP using fixed effect model [risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.88, P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001] with borderline high heterogeneity (I2 \\xa0=\\xa051%).

Bacterial peptide deformylase, which catalyzes the removal of the N-formyl group from N-terminal methionine following translation, is essential for bacterial protein synthesis, growth, and survival. The majority of PDIs are pseudopeptide hydroxamic acids and two of these (IV BB-83698 and oral NVP LBM-415) entered phase I human trials.

Their in vitro activity has been limited to gram-positive aerobes and some anaerobes and has been quite modest against the majority of such species (MIC(90) values ranging from 1-8 mg/L). They have exerted bacteriostatic, not bacteriocidal, activity, thus reducing their potential usefulness in the management of serious infections in the immunocompromised. The relative ease with which microorganisms have been able to develop resistance and the multiple available mechanisms of resistance (mutations in fmt, defB, folD genes; AcrAB/TolC efflux pump; overexpression of peptide deformylase) are worrisome.

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of the Gram-negative organism Acinetobacter baumannii utilize a number of resistance determinants to evade current antibiotics. One of the major resistance mechanisms employed by these pathogens is the use of multidrug efflux pumps. These pumps extrude xenobiotics directly out of bacterial cells, resulting in treatment failures when common antibiotics are administered. Here, the structure of the novel tetracycline antibiotic TP-6076, bound to both the Acinetobacter drug efflux pump AdeJ and the ribosome from Acinetobacter baumannii, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), is elucidated. In this work, the structure of the AdeJ-TP-6076 complex is solved, and we show that AdeJ utilizes a network of hydrophobic interactions to recognize this fluorocycline. Concomitant with this, we elucidate three structures of TP-6076 bound to the A. baumannii ribosome and determine that its binding is stabilized largely by electrostatic interactions. We then compare the differences in binding modes between TP-6076 and the related tetracycline antibiotic eravacycline in both targets. These differences suggest that modifications to the tetracycline core may be able to alter AdeJ binding while maintaining interactions with the ribosome. Together, this work highlights how different mechanisms are used to stabilize the binding of tetracycline-based compounds to unique bacterial targets and provides guidance for the future clinical development of tetracycline antibiotics. IMPORTANCE Treatment of antibiotic-resistant organisms such as A. baumannii represents an ongoing issue for modern medicine. The multidrug efflux pump AdeJ serves as a major resistance determinant in A. baumannii through its action of extruding antibiotics from the cell. In this work, we use cryo-EM to show how AdeJ recognizes the experimental tetracycline antibiotic TP-6076 and prevents this drug from interacting with the A. baumannii ribosome. Since AdeJ and the ribosome use different binding modes to stabilize interactions with TP-6076, exploiting these differences may guide future drug development for combating antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii and potentially other strains of MDR bacteria.',\n",

Polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales. Polymyxins were first discovered in the late 1940s but were abandoned soon after their approval in the late 1950s as a result of toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity) and the availability of \"safer\" antibiotics approved at that time. Therefore, knowledge on polymyxins had been scarce until recently, when enormous efforts have been made by several research teams around the world to elucidate the chemical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and toxicological properties of polymyxins. One of the major achievements is the development of the first scientifically based dosage regimens for colistin that are crucial to ensure its safe and effective use in patients. Although the guideline has not been developed for polymyxin B, a large clinical trial is currently being conducted to optimize its clinical use. Importantly, several novel, safer polymyxin-like lipopeptides are developed to overcome the nephrotoxicity, poor efficacy against pulmonary infections, and narrow therapeutic windows of the currently used polymyxin B and colistin. This review discusses the latest achievements on polymyxins and highlights the major challenges ahead in optimizing their clinical use and discovering new-generation polymyxins. To save lives from the deadly infections caused by Gram negative \"superbugs,\" every effort must be made to improve the clinical utility of the last-line polymyxins.

The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has been highlighted by leading global health organizations and authorities. Polymyxins are a last-line defense against difficult-to-treat MDR Gram negative pathogens. Unfortunately, the pharmacological information on polymyxins was very limited until recently.

In this study, we identified and characterized an endolysin, termed PlyPy (phage lysin from S. pyogenes), from a prophage infecting S. pyogenes. By in silico analysis, PlyPy was found to have a molecular mass of 27.8 kDa and a pI of 4.16. It was active against a majority of group A streptococci and displayed high levels of activity as well as binding specificity against group B and C streptococci, while it was less efficient against other streptococcal species. PlyPy showed the highest activity at neutral pH in the presence of calcium and NaCl. Surprisingly, its activity was not affected by the presence of the group A-specific carbohydrate, while the activity of PlyC was partly inhibited. Additionally, PlyPy was active in vivo and could rescue mice from systemic bacteremia. Finally, we developed a novel method to determine the peptidoglycan bond cleaved by lysins and concluded that PlyPy exhibits a rare d-alanyl-l-alanine endopeptidase activity. PlyPy thus represents the first lysin characterized from Streptococcus pyogenes and has a mechanism of action distinct from that of PlyC.',\n",

These diseases are treated with β-lactams or macrolides, but the emergence of less susceptible and even fully resistant strains is a cause for concern. New bacteriophage lysins could be promising alternatives against such organisms. They hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage cycle, in order to release the phage progeny. By using a bioinformatic approach to screen several beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gene coding for a lysin was identified on a prophage carried by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis SK1249. The gene product, named PlySK1249, harbored an original three-domain structure with a central cell wall-binding domain surrounded by an N-terminal amidase and a C-terminal CHAP domain. Purified PlySK1249 was highly lytic and bactericidal for S. dysgalactiae (2-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min). Moreover, it also efficiently killed S. agalactiae (1.5-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min) but not several streptococcal commensal species. We further investigated the activity of PlySK1249 in a mouse model of S. agalactiae bacteremia. Eighty percent of the animals (n = 10) challenged intraperitoneally with 10(6) CFU of S. agalactiae died within 72 h, whereas repeated injections of PlySK1249 (45 mg/kg 3 times within 24 h) significantly protected the mice (P < 0.01). Thus, PlySK1249, which was isolated from S. dysgalactiae, demonstrated high cross-lytic activity against S. agalactiae both in vitro and in vivo. These encouraging results indicated that PlySK1249 might represent a good candidate to be developed as a new enzybiotic for the treatment of systemic S. agalactiae infections.',\n",

              " ('beta-Lactamases constitute the major defense mechanism of pathogenic bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. When the beta-lactam ring of this antibiotic class is hydrolyzed, antimicrobial activity is destroyed. Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteracting this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Both of these molecules eventually inactivate the target enzymes permanently. Although clavulanic acid exhibits more potent inhibitory activity than sulbactam, especially against the TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, the spectrum of inhibitory activities are very similar. Neither of these inhibitors acts as a good inhibitor of the cephalosporinases. Clavulanic acid has been most frequently combined with amoxicillin in the orally active Augmentin and with ticarcillin in the parenteral beta-lactam combination Timentin. Sulbactam has been used primarily to protect ampicillin from enzymatic hydrolysis. Sulbactam has been used either in the orally absorbed prodrug form as sultamicillin or as the injectable combination ampicillin-sulbactam. Synergy has been demonstrated for these combinations for most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, although those organisms that produce cephalosporinases are not well inhibited. Synergy has also been observed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic organisms. These antibiotic combinations have been used clinically to treat urinary tract infections, bone and soft-tissue infections, gonorrhea, respiratory infections, and otitis media. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported for Augmentin and sultamicillin; most side effects with these agents have been mild. Although combination therapy with beta-lactamase inactivators has been used successfully, the problem of resistance development to two agents must be considered. Induction of cephalosporinases can occur with clavulanic acid. Permeability mutants could arise, especially with added pressure from a second beta-lactam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

Accumulating evidence indicates that SIRT1 is involved in bladder cancer tumorigenesis and is positively associated with chemo-resistance and poor prognosis. We recently synthesized water-soluble chemical derivatives of heliomycin, an antibiotic from Streptomyces resistomycificus, and demonstrated that they possess anticancer properties. In this present study, we used the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) in T24 bladder cancer cells to show that heliomycin (designated compound (H1)) and its 4-(tert-butylamino)methyl derivative (HD2) directly engaged with SIRT1 in the native cellular environment, whereas another derivative (HD3) did not. Upon binding, heliomycin downregulated SIRT1 protein expression without altering its transcript level, and subsequently induced autophagy. Interestingly, the derivative (HD2) triggered apoptosis. The interaction between SIRT1 protein and heliomycin or its derivatives was also speculated by a molecular docking simulation, suggesting heliomycin (H1) and derivative (HD2) acting with the different binding modes to SIRT1. Given the increased water-solubility, hydrogen bonds were found on Ala262 and Ile347 residues in the docked complex of derivative (HD2) to produce more steady interaction and initiate signaling pathways that were not observed in the case of heliomycin. Meanwhile, it is evident that derivative (HD3) did not engage with SIRT1 by CETSA or molecular docking studies, nor did it downregulate SIRT1 expression. Taken together, these findings clearly show that SIRT1 is targeted and downregulated by heliomycin and its water-soluble 4-aminomethylated derivative (HD2) possibly through autophagic and/or proteasomal degradation, leading to cell death and growth suppression of T24 bladder cancer cells.',\n",

Proteoglycan synthesis was determined by measurement of in vivo and ex vivo radiosulfate incorporation in mice. Collagen oxidative modifications were measured by carbonyl derivative detection by Western blotting. An experimental model of tendinous ischemia (2 h) and reperfusion (3 days) was achieved in rats. Biphasic changes in proteoglycan synthesis were observed after a single administration of pefloxacin, consisting of an early inhibition followed by a repair-like phase. The depletion phase was accompanied by a marked decrease in the endogenous serum sulfate level and a concomitant increase in the level of sulfate excretion in urine. Studies of ex vivo proteoglycan synthesis confirmed the in vivo results that were obtained. The decrease in proteoglycan anabolism seemed to be a direct effect of pefloxacin on tissue metabolism rather than a consequence of the low concentration of sulfate. Pefloxacin treatment for several days induced oxidative damage of type I collagen, with the alterations being identical to those observed in the experimental tendinous ischemia and reperfusion model.

For this reason, DNA gyrases are targeted by widely used antibiotics such as quinolones. Recently, structural and biochemical investigations identified a new class of DNA gyrase inhibitors called NBTIs (i.e., novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors). NBTIs are particularly promising because they are active against multi-drug resistant bacteria, an alarming clinical issue. Structural data recently demonstrated that these NBTIs bind tightly to a newly identified pocket at the dimer interface of the DNA-protein complex. In the present study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking calculations to shed new light on the binding of NBTIs to this site. Interestingly, our MD simulations demonstrate the intrinsic flexibility of this binding site, which allows the pocket to adapt its conformation and form optimal interactions with the ligand. In particular, we examined two ligands, AM8085 and AM8191, which induced a repositioning of a key aspartate (Asp83B), whose side chain can rotate within the binding site. The conformational rearrangement of Asp83B allows the formation of a newly identified H-bond interaction with an NH on the bound NBTI, which seems important for the binding of NBTIs having such functionality. We validated these findings through docking calculations using an extended set of cognate oxabicyclooctane-linked NBTIs derivatives (~150, in total), screened against multiple target conformations.

Importantly, we identify G2824 as the first-described Lgt inhibitor that potently inhibits Lgt biochemical activity in vitro and is bactericidal against wild-type Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli strains. While deletion of a gene encoding a major outer membrane lipoprotein, lpp, leads to rescue of bacterial growth after genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream type II signal peptidase, LspA, no such rescue of growth is detected after Lgt depletion or treatment with G2824. Inhibition of Lgt does not lead to significant accumulation of peptidoglycan-linked Lpp in the inner membrane. Our data validate Lgt as a novel antibacterial target and suggest that, unlike downstream steps in lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport, inhibition of Lgt may not be sensitive to one of the most common resistance mechanisms that invalidate inhibitors of bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport.

The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of MX-2401 and compare it with that of the lipopeptide daptomycin. The results indicated that although both daptomycin and MX-2401 are in the structural class of Ca²⁺-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics, the latter has a different mechanism of action. Specifically, MX-2401 inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis by binding to the substrate undecaprenylphosphate (C₅₅-P), the universal carbohydrate carrier involved in several biosynthetic pathways. This interaction resulted in inhibition, in a dose-dependent manner, of the biosynthesis of the cell wall precursors lipids I and II and the wall teichoic acid precursor lipid III, while daptomycin had no significant effect on these processes. MX-2401 induced very slow membrane depolarization that was observed only at high concentrations. Unlike daptomycin, membrane depolarization by MX-2401 did not correlate with its bactericidal activity and did not affect general membrane permeability.

It is most commonly known as a selection marker for cell lines genetically engineered to express a resistance transgene, but its additional uses as a probe for protein synthesis have proven invaluable across a wide variety of model systems, ranging from purified ribosomes and cell-free translation to intact cultured cells and whole animals. Puromycin is comprised of a nucleoside covalently bound to an amino acid, mimicking the 3' end of aminoacylated tRNAs that participate in delivery of amino acids to elongating ribosomes. Both moieties can tolerate some chemical substitutions and modifications without significant loss of activity, generating a diverse toolbox of puromycin-based reagents with added functionality, such as biotin for affinity purification or fluorophores for fluorescent microscopy detection. These reagents, as well as anti-puromycin antibodies, have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the regulation and dysregulation of protein synthesis in normal and pathological processes, including immune response and neurological function.

The chemistry of the composite meshes was examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photon spectroscopy showing incorporation of honey into the polymer matrix. Meshes incorporating honey had lower mechanical properties due to lower polymer content but were more hydrophilic, resulting in an increase in swelling and an accelerated degradation profile. The biocompatibility of the meshes was assessed using human dermal fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells, which showed comparable or higher cell metabolic activity and viability for SurgihoneyRO-containing meshes compared to polycaprolactone only meshes.

Although these new compounds' mechanism does not contain essential new elements, the question of shaping a new generation (the fifth) arises, based on higher potency and broad spectrum of activity, including resistant bacterial strains. The functional groups that ensured the biological activity, good pharmacokinetic properties and a safety profile were highlighted. In addition, these new representatives have a low risk of determining bacterial resistance. Several positive aspects are added to the fourth fluoroquinolones generation, characteristics that can be the basis of the fifth generation.

Acting as a permeability barrier, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) protects Gram-negative bacteria against drugs. LPS is synthesized in cells and transported to the outer membrane (OM) via seven lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins (LptA-LptG). Of these seven Lpt proteins, LptC interacts with LptA to transfer LPS from the inner membrane (IM) to the OM, and assembly is aided by LptD/LptE. This interaction among the Lpt proteins is important for the biosynthesis of LPS; therefore, the Lpt proteins, which are significant in the assembly process of LPS, can be a potential target for new antibiotics. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was used to screen compounds that could block LPS transport by inhibiting LptA/LptC interaction, which finally disrupts the biosynthesis of the OM. We selected the compound IMB-0042 for this study. Our results suggest that IMB-0042 disrupts LptA/LptC interaction by binding to both LptA and LptC. Escherichia coli cells, when treated with IMB-0042, showed filament morphology, impaired OM integrity, and an accumulation of LPS in the periplasm. IMB-0042 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria and showed synergistic sensitization to other antibiotics, with low cytotoxicity.

Bacterial peptide deformylase, which catalyzes the removal of the N-formyl group from N-terminal methionine following translation, is essential for bacterial protein synthesis, growth, and survival. The majority of PDIs are pseudopeptide hydroxamic acids and two of these (IV BB-83698 and oral NVP LBM-415) entered phase I human trials. However, agents to the present have suffered from major potential liabilities. Their in vitro activity has been limited to gram-positive aerobes and some anaerobes and has been quite modest against the majority of such species (MIC(90) values ranging from 1-8 mg/L). They have exerted bacteriostatic, not bacteriocidal, activity, thus reducing their potential usefulness in the management of serious infections in the immunocompromised. The relative ease with which microorganisms have been able to develop resistance and the multiple available mechanisms of resistance (mutations in fmt, defB, folD genes; AcrAB/TolC efflux pump; overexpression of peptide deformylase) are worrisome.

The patients were randomly assigned to four treatment groups as follows: patients in Groups 1 and 3 received rabeprazole (10 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg) and furazolidone (100 mg) twice daily for 7 and 10 d, respectively; patients in Groups 2 and 4 received rabeprazole (10 mg), bismuth (220 mg), amoxicillin (1000 mg) and furazolidone (100 mg) twice daily for 7 and 10 d, respectively. The primary outcome measure was H. pylori eradication rate 4 wk after treatment by intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis, while the secondary outcome measures were symptom and sign changes at the end of treatment and 4 wk after the end of treatment, as well as the proportion of patients who developed adverse events. The demographic data of the four groups were not significantly different. Overall, 666 patients completed the scheme and were re-assessed with the (13)C-urea breath test.

A search of the MEDLINE database for randomized clinical trials, cohort studies and review articles that examine the therapeutic use or potential adverse effects of clindamycin was undertaken for the years 1966 to 1996. In addition, relevant citations obtained from the references cited in the identified reviews, book chapters and antibiotic guidelines were included. Selected articles examining the indications for or adverse effects from the prophylactic or therapeutic use of clindamycin were selected. A level of evidence was assigned to the indication according to published criteria. Randomized clinical trials (level 1 evidence) support the use of clindamycin in a number of common conditions, including preoperative prophylaxis, intra-abdominal infections, recurrent group A streptococcal pharyngitis, Chlamydia trachomatis cervicitis and anaerobic lung infections. Cohort studies (level 2 evidence) support the use of clindamycin for bone and soft tissue infections. Expert opinion (level 3 evidence) supports the use of clindamycin for invasive group A streptococcal infection and the treatment of diabetic foot infections. Clindamycin's disadvantages are its high cost, the common occurrence of rash and the predisposition of patients taking clindamycin to Clostridium difficile-associated colitis. Based on cohort studies, the risk of severe diarrhea in out-patients is as low as one per 1000, but the risk of in-patients acquiring C difficile colonization may be as high as 30%.\",\n",

The compounds exploit beta-lactamases to release triclosan through hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring. Like cephalothin, NB2001 and NB2030 were hydrolyzed by class A beta-lactamases (Escherichia coli TEM-1 and, to a lesser degree, Staphylococcus aureus PC1) and class C beta-lactamases (Enterobacter cloacae P99 and E. coli AmpC) with comparable catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m)). They also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and E. coli, but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. Accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in E. coli consistent with the toxophore rather than the beta-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. In biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (FabI), with 50% inhibitory concentrations being markedly reduced relative to that of free triclosan. The transport of NB2001, NB2030, and triclosan was rapid, with significant accumulation of triclosan in both S. aureus and E. coli.

As with many antibacterial drugs, resistance to the tuberactinomycins is problematic in treating tuberculosis; this makes the development of new derivatives of these antibiotics to combat this resistance of utmost importance. To take steps towards developing new derivatives of this family of antibiotics, we have focused our efforts on understanding how these antibiotics are biosynthesized by the producing bacteria so that metabolic engineering of these pathways can be used to generate desired derivatives. Here we present the heterologous production of viomycin in Streptomyces lividans 1326 and the use of targeted-gene deletion as a mechanism for investigating viomycin biosynthesis as well as the generation of viomycin derivatives. Deletion of vioQ resulted in nonhydroxylated derivatives of viomycin, while strains lacking vioP failed to acylate the cyclic pentapeptide core of viomycin with beta-lysine. Surprisingly, strains lacking vioL produced derivatives that had the carbamoyl group of viomycin replaced by an acetyl group. Additionally, the acetylated viomycin derivatives were produced at very low levels. These two observations suggested that the carbamoyl group of the cyclic pentapeptide core of viomycin was introduced at an earlier step in the biosynthetic pathway than previously proposed. We present biochemical evidence that the carbamoyl group is added to the beta-amino group of L-2,3-diaminopropionate prior to incorporation of this amino acid by the nonribosomal peptide synthetases that form the cyclic pentapeptide cores of both viomycin and capreomycin.',\n",

The structural relationship to daptomycin and the excellent antibacterial performance of friulimicin make the antibiotic an attractive drug candidate. The complete friulimicin biosynthetic gene cluster of 24 open reading frames from A. friuliensis was sequenced and analyzed. In addition to genes for regulation, self-resistance, and transport, the cluster contains genes encoding peptide synthetases, proteins involved in the synthesis and linkage of the fatty acid component of the antibiotic, and proteins involved in the synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acids pipecolinic acid, methylaspartic acid, and 2,3-diaminobutyric acid. By using heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli, we provide biochemical evidence for the stereoselective synthesis of L-pipecolinic acid by the deduced protein of the lysine cyclodeaminase gene pip. Furthermore, we show the involvement of the dabA and dabB genes in the biosynthesis of 2,3-diaminobutyric acid by gene inactivation and subsequent feeding experiments.',\n",

              " ('Antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens continues to pose a serious global health threat. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of the Gram-negative organism Acinetobacter baumannii utilize a number of resistance determinants to evade current antibiotics. One of the major resistance mechanisms employed by these pathogens is the use of multidrug efflux pumps. These pumps extrude xenobiotics directly out of bacterial cells, resulting in treatment failures when common antibiotics are administered. Here, the structure of the novel tetracycline antibiotic TP-6076, bound to both the Acinetobacter drug efflux pump AdeJ and the ribosome from Acinetobacter baumannii, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), is elucidated. In this work, the structure of the AdeJ-TP-6076 complex is solved, and we show that AdeJ utilizes a network of hydrophobic interactions to recognize this fluorocycline. Concomitant with this, we elucidate three structures of TP-6076 bound to the A. baumannii ribosome and determine that its binding is stabilized largely by electrostatic interactions. We then compare the differences in binding modes between TP-6076 and the related tetracycline antibiotic eravacycline in both targets. These differences suggest that modifications to the tetracycline core may be able to alter AdeJ binding while maintaining interactions with the ribosome. Together, this work highlights how different mechanisms are used to stabilize the binding of tetracycline-based compounds to unique bacterial targets and provides guidance for the future clinical development of tetracycline antibiotics. IMPORTANCE Treatment of antibiotic-resistant organisms such as A. baumannii represents an ongoing issue for modern medicine. The multidrug efflux pump AdeJ serves as a major resistance determinant in A. baumannii through its action of extruding antibiotics from the cell. In this work, we use cryo-EM to show how AdeJ recognizes the experimental tetracycline antibiotic TP-6076 and prevents this drug from interacting with the A. baumannii ribosome. Since AdeJ and the ribosome use different binding modes to stabilize interactions with TP-6076, exploiting these differences may guide future drug development for combating antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii and potentially other strains of MDR bacteria.',\n",

              " ('Antibiotic resistance is a major global health challenge and, worryingly, several key Gram negative pathogens can become resistant to most currently available antibiotics. Polymyxins have been revived as a last-line therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacteria, in particular Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales. Polymyxins were first discovered in the late 1940s but were abandoned soon after their approval in the late 1950s as a result of toxicities (e.g., nephrotoxicity) and the availability of \"safer\" antibiotics approved at that time. Therefore, knowledge on polymyxins had been scarce until recently, when enormous efforts have been made by several research teams around the world to elucidate the chemical, microbiological, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and toxicological properties of polymyxins. One of the major achievements is the development of the first scientifically based dosage regimens for colistin that are crucial to ensure its safe and effective use in patients. Although the guideline has not been developed for polymyxin B, a large clinical trial is currently being conducted to optimize its clinical use. Importantly, several novel, safer polymyxin-like lipopeptides are developed to overcome the nephrotoxicity, poor efficacy against pulmonary infections, and narrow therapeutic windows of the currently used polymyxin B and colistin. This review discusses the latest achievements on polymyxins and highlights the major challenges ahead in optimizing their clinical use and discovering new-generation polymyxins. To save lives from the deadly infections caused by Gram negative \"superbugs,\" every effort must be made to improve the clinical utility of the last-line polymyxins.

The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has been highlighted by leading global health organizations and authorities. Polymyxins are a last-line defense against difficult-to-treat MDR Gram negative pathogens. Unfortunately, the pharmacological information on polymyxins was very limited until recently.

PlyC, a group C streptococcal phage lysin, represents the most efficient lysin characterized to date, with a remarkably high specificity against different streptococcal species, including the important pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. However, PlyC is a unique lysin, in terms of both its high activity and structure (two distinct subunits). We sought to discover and characterize a phage lysin active against S. pyogenes with an endolysin architecture distinct from that of PlyC to determine if it relies on the same mechanism of action as PlyC. In this study, we identified and characterized an endolysin, termed PlyPy (phage lysin from S. pyogenes), from a prophage infecting S. pyogenes. By in silico analysis, PlyPy was found to have a molecular mass of 27.8 kDa and a pI of 4.16. It was active against a majority of group A streptococci and displayed high levels of activity as well as binding specificity against group B and C streptococci, while it was less efficient against other streptococcal species. PlyPy showed the highest activity at neutral pH in the presence of calcium and NaCl. Surprisingly, its activity was not affected by the presence of the group A-specific carbohydrate, while the activity of PlyC was partly inhibited. Additionally, PlyPy was active in vivo and could rescue mice from systemic bacteremia. Finally, we developed a novel method to determine the peptidoglycan bond cleaved by lysins and concluded that PlyPy exhibits a rare d-alanyl-l-alanine endopeptidase activity. PlyPy thus represents the first lysin characterized from Streptococcus pyogenes and has a mechanism of action distinct from that of PlyC.',\n",

These diseases are treated with β-lactams or macrolides, but the emergence of less susceptible and even fully resistant strains is a cause for concern. New bacteriophage lysins could be promising alternatives against such organisms. They hydrolyze the bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage cycle, in order to release the phage progeny. By using a bioinformatic approach to screen several beta-hemolytic streptococci, a gene coding for a lysin was identified on a prophage carried by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis SK1249. The gene product, named PlySK1249, harbored an original three-domain structure with a central cell wall-binding domain surrounded by an N-terminal amidase and a C-terminal CHAP domain. Purified PlySK1249 was highly lytic and bactericidal for S. dysgalactiae (2-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min). Moreover, it also efficiently killed S. agalactiae (1.5-log10 CFU/ml decrease within 15 min) but not several streptococcal commensal species. We further investigated the activity of PlySK1249 in a mouse model of S. agalactiae bacteremia. Eighty percent of the animals (n = 10) challenged intraperitoneally with 10(6) CFU of S. agalactiae died within 72 h, whereas repeated injections of PlySK1249 (45 mg/kg 3 times within 24 h) significantly protected the mice (P < 0.01). Thus, PlySK1249, which was isolated from S. dysgalactiae, demonstrated high cross-lytic activity against S. agalactiae both in vitro and in vivo. These encouraging results indicated that PlySK1249 might represent a good candidate to be developed as a new enzybiotic for the treatment of systemic S. agalactiae infections.',\n",

When the beta-lactam ring of this antibiotic class is hydrolyzed, antimicrobial activity is destroyed. Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteracting this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Both of these molecules eventually inactivate the target enzymes permanently. Although clavulanic acid exhibits more potent inhibitory activity than sulbactam, especially against the TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, the spectrum of inhibitory activities are very similar. Neither of these inhibitors acts as a good inhibitor of the cephalosporinases. Clavulanic acid has been most frequently combined with amoxicillin in the orally active Augmentin and with ticarcillin in the parenteral beta-lactam combination Timentin. Sulbactam has been used primarily to protect ampicillin from enzymatic hydrolysis. Sulbactam has been used either in the orally absorbed prodrug form as sultamicillin or as the injectable combination ampicillin-sulbactam. Synergy has been demonstrated for these combinations for most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, although those organisms that produce cephalosporinases are not well inhibited. Synergy has also been observed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic organisms. These antibiotic combinations have been used clinically to treat urinary tract infections, bone and soft-tissue infections, gonorrhea, respiratory infections, and otitis media. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported for Augmentin and sultamicillin; most side effects with these agents have been mild. Although combination therapy with beta-lactamase inactivators has been used successfully, the problem of resistance development to two agents must be considered. Induction of cephalosporinases can occur with clavulanic acid. Permeability mutants could arise, especially with added pressure from a second beta-lactam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

Accumulating evidence indicates that SIRT1 is involved in bladder cancer tumorigenesis and is positively associated with chemo-resistance and poor prognosis. We recently synthesized water-soluble chemical derivatives of heliomycin, an antibiotic from Streptomyces resistomycificus, and demonstrated that they possess anticancer properties. In this present study, we used the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) in T24 bladder cancer cells to show that heliomycin (designated compound (H1)) and its 4-(tert-butylamino)methyl derivative (HD2) directly engaged with SIRT1 in the native cellular environment, whereas another derivative (HD3) did not. Upon binding, heliomycin downregulated SIRT1 protein expression without altering its transcript level, and subsequently induced autophagy. Interestingly, the derivative (HD2) triggered apoptosis. The interaction between SIRT1 protein and heliomycin or its derivatives was also speculated by a molecular docking simulation, suggesting heliomycin (H1) and derivative (HD2) acting with the different binding modes to SIRT1. Given the increased water-solubility, hydrogen bonds were found on Ala262 and Ile347 residues in the docked complex of derivative (HD2) to produce more steady interaction and initiate signaling pathways that were not observed in the case of heliomycin. Meanwhile, it is evident that derivative (HD3) did not engage with SIRT1 by CETSA or molecular docking studies, nor did it downregulate SIRT1 expression. Taken together, these findings clearly show that SIRT1 is targeted and downregulated by heliomycin and its water-soluble 4-aminomethylated derivative (HD2) possibly through autophagic and/or proteasomal degradation, leading to cell death and growth suppression of T24 bladder cancer cells.',\n",

Proteoglycan synthesis was determined by measurement of in vivo and ex vivo radiosulfate incorporation in mice. Collagen oxidative modifications were measured by carbonyl derivative detection by Western blotting. An experimental model of tendinous ischemia (2 h) and reperfusion (3 days) was achieved in rats. Biphasic changes in proteoglycan synthesis were observed after a single administration of pefloxacin, consisting of an early inhibition followed by a repair-like phase. The depletion phase was accompanied by a marked decrease in the endogenous serum sulfate level and a concomitant increase in the level of sulfate excretion in urine. Studies of ex vivo proteoglycan synthesis confirmed the in vivo results that were obtained. The decrease in proteoglycan anabolism seemed to be a direct effect of pefloxacin on tissue metabolism rather than a consequence of the low concentration of sulfate. Pefloxacin treatment for several days induced oxidative damage of type I collagen, with the alterations being identical to those observed in the experimental tendinous ischemia and reperfusion model.

For this reason, DNA gyrases are targeted by widely used antibiotics such as quinolones. Recently, structural and biochemical investigations identified a new class of DNA gyrase inhibitors called NBTIs (i.e., novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors). NBTIs are particularly promising because they are active against multi-drug resistant bacteria, an alarming clinical issue. Structural data recently demonstrated that these NBTIs bind tightly to a newly identified pocket at the dimer interface of the DNA-protein complex. In the present study, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking calculations to shed new light on the binding of NBTIs to this site. Interestingly, our MD simulations demonstrate the intrinsic flexibility of this binding site, which allows the pocket to adapt its conformation and form optimal interactions with the ligand. In particular, we examined two ligands, AM8085 and AM8191, which induced a repositioning of a key aspartate (Asp83B), whose side chain can rotate within the binding site. The conformational rearrangement of Asp83B allows the formation of a newly identified H-bond interaction with an NH on the bound NBTI, which seems important for the binding of NBTIs having such functionality. We validated these findings through docking calculations using an extended set of cognate oxabicyclooctane-linked NBTIs derivatives (~150, in total), screened against multiple target conformations.

Here we report its PK profile after the administration of multiple oral doses of a suspension to healthy adults. Bioequivalence between suspension and capsule formulations, as well as the effect of food, is also reported. The most important PK features of EDP-420 observed in these clinical studies are its long half-life of 17 to 18 h and its high systemic exposure, which support once-daily dosing and treatment durations potentially shorter than those of most other macrolide antibiotics. EDP-420 is readily absorbed following oral administration in both suspension and capsule formulations. In the multiple-oral-dose study, steady state was achieved on day 1 by using a loading dose of 400 mg/day, followed by 2 days of 200 mg/day. A high-fat meal had no effect on the bioavailability of EDP-420 administered in a capsule formulation. EDP-420 was well tolerated, with no serious or severe adverse events reported, and no subject was discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. Based on its human PK and safety profiles, together with its in vitro/in vivo activities against common respiratory pathogens, EDP-420 warrants further development, including trials for clinical efficacy in the treatment of RTI.',\n",

The searches returned a total of 705 hits. 632 abstracts were screened after the removal of duplicates. Following screening, 35 full-length publications were reviewed. Of these, 17 were excluded, resulting in 18 studies deemed relevant for data extraction. Two were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 16 were non-RCTs, and 10 were case reports.

Importantly, we identify G2824 as the first-described Lgt inhibitor that potently inhibits Lgt biochemical activity in vitro and is bactericidal against wild-type Acinetobacter baumannii and E. coli strains. While deletion of a gene encoding a major outer membrane lipoprotein, lpp, leads to rescue of bacterial growth after genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the downstream type II signal peptidase, LspA, no such rescue of growth is detected after Lgt depletion or treatment with G2824. Inhibition of Lgt does not lead to significant accumulation of peptidoglycan-linked Lpp in the inner membrane. Our data validate Lgt as a novel antibacterial target and suggest that, unlike downstream steps in lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport, inhibition of Lgt may not be sensitive to one of the most common resistance mechanisms that invalidate inhibitors of bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis and transport.

The results indicated that although both daptomycin and MX-2401 are in the structural class of Ca²⁺-dependent lipopeptide antibiotics, the latter has a different mechanism of action.

This interaction resulted in inhibition, in a dose-dependent manner, of the biosynthesis of the cell wall precursors lipids I and II and the wall teichoic acid precursor lipid III, while daptomycin had no significant effect on these processes. MX-2401 induced very slow membrane depolarization that was observed only at high concentrations.

Adenylation domain-mediated lipoinitiation of bogorols represents a novel pathway by which NRPs incorporate fatty acid tails. This pathway provides the possibility to engineer the lipid tail of NRPs without identifying a fatty acid coenzyme ligase, which is usually not present in the biosynthetic gene cluster. The terminal reductase domain (TD) and BogI-mediated valinol formation and their effect on the biological activity of bogorols are revealed. Succinylation, which is rarely reported in NRPs, was discovered in the bogorol family of peptides. We demonstrate that bogorols combat bacterial pathogens by forming pores in the cell membrane. We also report the synergistic effect of two natural products (relacidine B and bogorol K) produced by the same strain, which is relevant for competition for a niche.',\n",

              " (\"Novobiocin, coumermycin A1, and clorobiocin, structurally related compounds that antagonize the B subunit of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, were compared with 18 of their analogs for the inhibition of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase supertwisting activity in vitro and of bacterial multiplication. This family of compounds has a 4-hydroxy-8-methylcoumarin core substituted in the 7 and 3 positions. Important for enzyme inhibition in vitro is a 7 ether linkage to a 3'-substituted noviose sugar. The 3'-ester-linked 5-methylpyrrole, found in the coumermycin series, conferred at least 10-fold more inhibitory activity than did the similarly linked amide, found in the novobiocin series; lack of the pyrrole and amide results in the loss of inhibitory activity. Of many aryl and alkyl substituents linked as an amide at the 3 position, the 4-hydroxyl-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)benzoic acid moiety, found in novobiocin and clorobiocin, and the reduplication of the coumarin-noviose-5-methylpyrrole, found in coumermycin A1, were most effective in gyrase inhibition. In vivo, the ability of these compounds to inhibit the growth of E. coli varied greatly. The enhanced inhibition of gyrase in vitro conferred by a 5-methylpyrrole relative to an amide in the 3'-noviose position was reflected in inhibition of bacterial multiplication. Several substitutions at the 3 position of the coumarin core conferring similar antagonism of gyrase in vitro resulted in substantially different inhibitory activities for E. coli, suggesting that these moieties at the 3 position affect drug access to the intracellular target. This target was shown for isobutyryl PNC-NH2 (PNC-NH2 is 3-amino-4-hydroxy-8-methyl-7-[3-O-(5-methyl-2-pyrrolylcarbonyl)noviosyloxy] coumarin) and confirmed for novobiocin, coumermycin A1, and clorobiocin to be in the B subunit of DNA gyrase.\",\n",

It is most commonly known as a selection marker for cell lines genetically engineered to express a resistance transgene, but its additional uses as a probe for protein synthesis have proven invaluable across a wide variety of model systems, ranging from purified ribosomes and cell-free translation to intact cultured cells and whole animals. Puromycin is comprised of a nucleoside covalently bound to an amino acid, mimicking the 3' end of aminoacylated tRNAs that participate in delivery of amino acids to elongating ribosomes. Both moieties can tolerate some chemical substitutions and modifications without significant loss of activity, generating a diverse toolbox of puromycin-based reagents with added functionality, such as biotin for affinity purification or fluorophores for fluorescent microscopy detection. These reagents, as well as anti-puromycin antibodies, have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the regulation and dysregulation of protein synthesis in normal and pathological processes, including immune response and neurological function.

Here, a comprehensive screening was implemented to identify potential agents that disrupt the assembly of β-barrel outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) in the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. The assembly of OMPs requires ubiquitous β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM). Among the five protein subunits in BAM, the interaction between BamA and BamD is essential for the function of this complex. We first established a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to confirm the interaction between BamA and BamD, and then screened agents that specifically disrupt this interaction. From this screen, we identified a compound IMB-H4 that specially blocks BamA-BamD interaction and selectively inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, our results suggest that IMB-H4 disrupts BamA-BamD interaction by binding to BamA. Strikingly, E. coli cells having been treated with IMB-H4 showed impaired OM integrity and decreased the abundance of OMPs. Therefore, an antibacterial agent was identified successfully using Y2H system, and this compound likely blocks the assembly of OMPs by targeting BamA-BamD interaction in Gram-negative bacteria.',\n",

Although many representatives were withdrawn due to severe adverse reactions, a few representatives have proven their therapeutical value over time. The classification of antibacterial quinolones into generations is a valuable tool for physicians, pharmacists, and researchers. In addition, the transition from one generation to another has brought new representatives with improved properties. In the last two decades, several representatives of antibacterial quinolones received approval for therapy. This review sets out to chronologically outline the group of approved antibacterial quinolones since 2000. Special attention is given to eight representatives: besifloxacin, delafoxacin, finafloxacin, lascufloxacin, nadifloxacin and levonadifloxacin, nemonoxacin, and zabofloxacin. These compounds have been characterized regarding physicochemical properties, formulations, antibacterial activity spectrum and advantageous structural characteristics related to antibacterial efficiency. At present these new compounds (with the exception of nadifloxacin) are reported differently, most often in the fourth generation and less frequently in a new generation (the fifth). Although these new compounds' mechanism does not contain essential new elements, the question of shaping a new generation (the fifth) arises, based on higher potency and broad spectrum of activity, including resistant bacterial strains. The functional groups that ensured the biological activity, good pharmacokinetic properties and a safety profile were highlighted. In addition, these new representatives have a low risk of determining bacterial resistance. Several positive aspects are added to the fourth fluoroquinolones generation, characteristics that can be the basis of the fifth generation. Antibacterial quinolones class continues to acquire new compounds with antibacterial potential, among other effects.

Acting as a permeability barrier, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) protects Gram-negative bacteria against drugs. LPS is synthesized in cells and transported to the outer membrane (OM) via seven lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins (LptA-LptG). Of these seven Lpt proteins, LptC interacts with LptA to transfer LPS from the inner membrane (IM) to the OM, and assembly is aided by LptD/LptE. This interaction among the Lpt proteins is important for the biosynthesis of LPS; therefore, the Lpt proteins, which are significant in the assembly process of LPS, can be a potential target for new antibiotics. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was used to screen compounds that could block LPS transport by inhibiting LptA/LptC interaction, which finally disrupts the biosynthesis of the OM. We selected the compound IMB-0042 for this study. Our results suggest that IMB-0042 disrupts LptA/LptC interaction by binding to both LptA and LptC. Escherichia coli cells, when treated with IMB-0042, showed filament morphology, impaired OM integrity, and an accumulation of LPS in the periplasm. IMB-0042 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria and showed synergistic sensitization to other antibiotics, with low cytotoxicity.

Bacterial peptide deformylase, which catalyzes the removal of the N-formyl group from N-terminal methionine following translation, is essential for bacterial protein synthesis, growth, and survival. The majority of PDIs are pseudopeptide hydroxamic acids and two of these (IV BB-83698 and oral NVP LBM-415) entered phase I human trials.

Their in vitro activity has been limited to gram-positive aerobes and some anaerobes and has been quite modest against the majority of such species (MIC(90) values ranging from 1-8 mg/L). They have exerted bacteriostatic, not bacteriocidal, activity, thus reducing their potential usefulness in the management of serious infections in the immunocompromised. The relative ease with which microorganisms have been able to develop resistance and the multiple available mechanisms of resistance (mutations in fmt, defB, folD genes; AcrAB/TolC efflux pump; overexpression of peptide deformylase) are worrisome.

Since the action of the drug is easily reversed, thiolutin may prove to be of use in studies of various stages of yeast growth.',\n",

Natural modifications at the C-5 dialkyl position in this molecular series result in pronounced bioactivity differences. The C-5 acetamide-containing thiotetroamide, which is the more potent antibacterial agent in this family, is biosynthesized from the C-5 ethyl analogue thiotetromycin via a unique two-enzyme process involving the cytochrome P450-amidotransferase enzyme pair TtmP-TtmN. Herein we synthesized a focused library of 17 novel thiotetromycin derivatives differing at the 5-position alkyl substituent to investigate their biological activities and their reactivity towards the hydroxylase TtmP. Although we observed marginal anti-tuberculosis activity, select thiotetromycin analogues showed antibacterial activity against an Escherichia coli ΔtolC strain with IC50 values in a range of 1.9-36 μg mL-1. Additional screening efforts highlighted select thiotetronate analogues as inhibitors of the cancer-associated enzyme nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), with a unique scaffold compared to previously identified NNMT inhibitors. In vitro assays further showed that the TtmP P450 was capable of resolving racemic substrate mixtures and had modest promiscuity to hydroxylate derivatives with variable alkyl chains; however triple oxidation to a carboxylic acid remained specific for the natural thiotetromycin substrate. The tendency of TtmP to accept a range of unnatural substrates for hydroxylation makes it an interesting target for P450 engineering towards broader applications.',\n",

In addition, relevant citations obtained from the references cited in the identified reviews, book chapters and antibiotic guidelines were included. Selected articles examining the indications for or adverse effects from the prophylactic or therapeutic use of clindamycin were selected.

Cohort studies (level 2 evidence) support the use of clindamycin for bone and soft tissue infections. Expert opinion (level 3 evidence) supports the use of clindamycin for invasive group A streptococcal infection and the treatment of diabetic foot infections.

They also bound to the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and E. coli, but with reduced affinities relative to that of cephalothin. Accordingly, they produced a cell morphology in E. coli consistent with the toxophore rather than the beta-lactam being responsible for antibacterial activity. In biochemical assays, they inhibited the triclosan target enoyl reductase (FabI), with 50% inhibitory concentrations being markedly reduced relative to that of free triclosan.

As with many antibacterial drugs, resistance to the tuberactinomycins is problematic in treating tuberculosis; this makes the development of new derivatives of these antibiotics to combat this resistance of utmost importance. To take steps towards developing new derivatives of this family of antibiotics, we have focused our efforts on understanding how these antibiotics are biosynthesized by the producing bacteria so that metabolic engineering of these pathways can be used to generate desired derivatives. Here we present the heterologous production of viomycin in Streptomyces lividans 1326 and the use of targeted-gene deletion as a mechanism for investigating viomycin biosynthesis as well as the generation of viomycin derivatives. Deletion of vioQ resulted in nonhydroxylated derivatives of viomycin, while strains lacking vioP failed to acylate the cyclic pentapeptide core of viomycin with beta-lysine. Surprisingly, strains lacking vioL produced derivatives that had the carbamoyl group of viomycin replaced by an acetyl group. Additionally, the acetylated viomycin derivatives were produced at very low levels. These two observations suggested that the carbamoyl group of the cyclic pentapeptide core of viomycin was introduced at an earlier step in the biosynthetic pathway than previously proposed. We present biochemical evidence that the carbamoyl group is added to the beta-amino group of L-2,3-diaminopropionate prior to incorporation of this amino acid by the nonribosomal peptide synthetases that form the cyclic pentapeptide cores of both viomycin and capreomycin.',\n",

When the beta-lactam ring of this antibiotic class is hydrolyzed, antimicrobial activity is destroyed. Although beta-lactamases have been identified with clinical failures for over 40 years, enzymes with various abilities to hydrolyze specific penicillins or cephalosporins are appearing more frequently in clinical isolates. One approach to counteracting this resistance mechanism has been through the development of beta-lactamase inactivators. beta-Lactamase inhibitors include clavulanic acid and sulbactam, molecules with minimal antibiotic activity. However, when combined with safe and efficacious penicillins or cephalosporins, these inhibitors can serve to protect the familiar beta-lactam antibiotics from hydrolysis by penicillinases or broad-spectrum beta-lactamases. Both of these molecules eventually inactivate the target enzymes permanently. Although clavulanic acid exhibits more potent inhibitory activity than sulbactam, especially against the TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, the spectrum of inhibitory activities are very similar. Neither of these inhibitors acts as a good inhibitor of the cephalosporinases. Clavulanic acid has been most frequently combined with amoxicillin in the orally active Augmentin and with ticarcillin in the parenteral beta-lactam combination Timentin. Sulbactam has been used primarily to protect ampicillin from enzymatic hydrolysis. Sulbactam has been used either in the orally absorbed prodrug form as sultamicillin or as the injectable combination ampicillin-sulbactam. Synergy has been demonstrated for these combinations for most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, although those organisms that produce cephalosporinases are not well inhibited. Synergy has also been observed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic organisms. These antibiotic combinations have been used clinically to treat urinary tract infections, bone and soft-tissue infections, gonorrhea, respiratory infections, and otitis media. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported for Augmentin and sultamicillin; most side effects with these agents have been mild. Although combination therapy with beta-lactamase inactivators has been used successfully, the problem of resistance development to two agents must be considered.
